# The Glass Tally

## Chapter 1: The Measure at Dawn

The dawn light hit the ridge like a blade, warming the frost on the pipes into slow beads. Nara Quill stood at the upper valve tower with a slate in one hand and a caliper in the other, her breath a thin ribbon in the cold air. Below her, the plateau city of Ardent Cut slept in its tiers, rooftops of red clay and solar shingles catching the first gold.

A bell clanged once from the cistern house. The sound was metallic and flat, carried on wind that smelled of iron and wet stone. Nara set the caliper against the glass rod in the tally cradle. It was as clear as frozen water, banded with faint milky rings that marked yesterday’s draw. She slid her thumb down the rod until it met the newest ring, then copied the measure onto her slate.

Behind her, the door creaked. Rho, the valve tender, stepped out with a tin cup of tea steaming in his hands. His sleeves were patched with so many shades of gray that he looked like a quilt.

“Morning, Auditor.” He offered the cup.

“Morning.” She accepted, letting the heat bite her fingers. The tea smelled of bitterleaf and smoke.

“Did you hear the lower quarter’s coughers?” Rho asked, nodding toward the east where a thin plume of steam drifted.

Nara shook her head. “I heard the bell. That was enough.”

Rho’s mouth tightened. “They’re drawing before their allotment again. The night crew says the ring grew two notches.”

“Two notches is a whole day for them.” Nara set the cup down on the sill, adjusted the tally rod. The glass vibrated faintly, a humming like a distant flute. “I’ll be down at midday. The tower’s measure has to match the wells.”

Rho watched the glass with a wary look. “You still trust the tally?”

She hesitated. The tally glass had outlasted two governors and a flood; it was supposed to be neutral, an artifact that recorded truth by physics rather than decree. “I trust it more than I trust people,” she said.

He gave a dry laugh. “Then you’re still a young auditor.”

When she descended, the platform’s bolts were cold against her palm. She locked the cradle, stored the caliper, and took the narrow stairs down. Each step clanged, and the sound echoed in the hollow shaft. At the base, she touched the etched emblem on the tower’s iron door—three droplets encircled by a glass ring. The symbol of the Water Guild.

Nara was not guild. She was chartered by the Council, a house of ten seats and three factions. Her job was to watch the glass, to tally each ring, to interpret its story into quotas and warnings. It was a job that kept her awake and unfriended, and she’d learned to love it.

Outside, the street smelled of baked clay and citrus peel. A vendor had set up a jar of preserved lemons on his cart; their bright skins were a small sun. Nara paused, fingers brushing the jar’s cool glass. If the tally said the city’s draw had increased by even a half ring, those lemons would be a memory by next season.

She crossed to the edge of the terrace where the main pipe ran, a thick spine of riveted iron with seams that clicked as hot water pulsed through. She laid her palm against it and felt the vibration in her bones. The pipe’s warmth was a comfort and a warning, a reminder that everything in Ardent Cut flowed through a system of joints and valves. A loose bolt could waste a household’s worth of water in an hour. She had a tool roll with a spanner, and she checked three bolts out of habit, tightening the last by a quarter turn until the metal sang.

Below the pipe, a maintenance hatch stood open. The apprentice on duty, a boy with oil streaks on his cheek, was crouched inside with a lantern. He looked up as she approached. “Auditor, the pressure is dropping,” he said, holding up a gauge. The needle trembled near the red mark.

“Storm front?” she asked.

“Not yet. The pump from the snow line is lagging. We’re getting silt in the intake again.” His voice held worry and pride, as if the pump were a stubborn animal he was trying to coax.

Nara inhaled. The air smelled of wet metal and dust. “Log it and send to the pump team. If the intake clogs, the upper reservoir will drop a ring by afternoon.” She tapped her slate, the sound a small clack against the pipe’s low hum.

The boy nodded and, with a flick of his lantern, lowered himself back into the hatch. Nara watched the light fade, then closed the hatch with a clang. The sound echoed down the terrace, a beat in the city’s daily rhythm.

A child raced past with a spout wrench tucked under her arm. “You’re late,” the child shouted to no one. Somewhere, a water horn sounded, long and low. Nara took her slate and walked toward the lower quarter.

## Chapter 2: The Wells Below

The lower quarter clung to the slope beneath the main terraces like lichen. Its homes were built from scavenged stone and corrugated scrap, walls painted with white wash to reflect the sun. Here the air was warmer, thick with the damp smell of stored water and cooked grain.

Nara approached the communal well and its ring of waiting basins. People stood in a careful line, holding jars, buckets, and a single brass kettle that must have been polished a hundred times. The tally cradle above the well held a glass rod like the one at the tower, but it was foggier, its rings blurred by use.

A woman with a scarred forearm stepped forward. She wore a headwrap tied with a bone pin. “Auditor.” Her voice was rough. “We did not draw extra. The ring is wrong.”

Nara opened her slate. “Your draw was twelve measures yesterday. The rod shows fourteen.” She tapped the glass lightly. The rod chimed and the ring at the base shimmered.

“We had six families displaced from the upper kiln collapse.” The woman’s eyes were flint. “They were sent here with no allotment.”

“I know.” Nara glanced at the makeshift shelter near the wall, a canvas stretched over a frame of pipe. Someone had hung a bell from a nail, its surface dull from hands. “But you didn’t file a petition for a temporary increase.”

“We filed it.” A second voice, a man with a clay-stained shirt. He held up a folded form, stamped but unsigned. “The clerk said the Council was in session.”

Nara looked at the paper. The stamp was genuine. The refusal line was blank. She slid the paper into her satchel. “I’ll take this.”

“Take it to who?” the woman asked. “To the Council? To the Guild? To the same glass that says we’re thieves?”

A few in line murmured agreement. A metal spoon clinked against a basin. Nara felt the weight of their eyes. Her job was numbers. It was not to argue with hunger.

“I’m not your enemy,” she said, keeping her voice steady. “I’ll check the upper tally. If the ring is wrong, we will recalibrate.”

The woman nodded, but her jaw stayed tight. “Then hurry.”

Nara left the well and climbed toward the petition office, a narrow room carved into the hillside with a brass slot for requests. Inside, the air smelled of damp paper and beeswax. A clerk sat behind a desk littered with seals, wax chips, and a wooden stamp pressed flat from overuse. He looked up as she approached, his eyes cautious.

“Auditor Quill,” he said. “Petition logs are Council property.”

“So is the tally,” Nara replied, placing the petition on his desk. “Show me the entry.”

He hesitated, then pulled out a leather-bound ledger. Its pages were soft from handling, ink smudged where palms had brushed. Nara watched his finger trace the column labeled LOWER. The line for yesterday was a thin scratch covered with fresh ink, the kind that shone wetly in lamplight even though the rest of the page had dried matte.

“Someone altered this,” Nara said.

The clerk’s jaw flexed. “We were told to consolidate.” He glanced toward the back room, where a door stood ajar and the smell of glue seeped out. “Orders came late.”

“From who?” Nara asked.

He closed the ledger with a soft thump. “You know as well as I do. The Guild brings the ink, the Council brings the stamp.”

She took the ledger’s impression with her eye, the ghost number beneath the ink. “If you keep logs like this,” she said, “the tally won’t save you.”

The clerk looked at his hands, stained blue at the fingertips. “The tally doesn’t save anyone. It just tells the story after the fact.”

Nara stepped back into the sunlight. The air was warmer on the upper steps, the stone rough under her palm. She could hear the well line moving below, the scrape of buckets and the faint clang of a spoon against a basin. The city carried on, even as its records were rewritten.

At the edge of the well house, a small boy sat on a crate, spinning a pebble on the ground. The pebble clicked against the stone, steady as a heartbeat. He looked up as Nara passed.

“My mother says you count water by listening to the glass,” he said.

Nara smiled despite herself. “I do more than listen. I measure.”

“How does the glass talk?”

“It doesn’t talk.” She paused, looked at the rod. In its surface, a faint spiral was visible, a defect or a feature. “It hums. If you’re quiet.”

He held up the pebble. “This hums too, if you put it on the stove.”

She laughed softly. “Don’t do that.”

As she left, the well line moved, buckets scraping on stone. The sound was a rough rhythm, punctuated by the splashes of water into basins. She climbed toward the Council offices with the sun rising, and the rings of the tallies weighing heavier than the slate in her hand.

## Chapter 3: The Council Ledger

The Council hall was carved into the hillside, its entrance framed by dark basalt columns. Inside, the air smelled of ink and wax. A circular table sat in the center, marked with etchings of the watershed. Nara laid her slate on the table, feeling the smooth, cool surface under her palm.

Councilor Sil Marten, leader of the Land faction, looked up from a map. Her hair was bound in a silver clasp shaped like a leaf. “Auditor Quill, you sent notice of a discrepancy.”

“I did.” Nara placed the lower quarter’s petition on the table. “They filed for emergency allotment after the kiln collapse. The tally shows them drawing extra without approval. But the petition is stamped and has no response. Where did it go?”

Sil frowned. “We were in session. Our clerk may have misplaced it.”

“Misplaced?” Councilor Vesh, of the Craft faction, leaned forward. His hands were ink-stained. “That’s not in procedure. Petitions must be logged.”

Nara kept her eyes on Sil. “If the petition was filed, the extra draw is legal. The tally should show a mark for a sanctioned increase.”

Sil’s gaze drifted to the window, where light glinted on the city’s main pipe. “The tally glass records draw, not intent.”

“It records draw and tags,” Nara said. “A sanction mark should have been etched by the clerk’s stamp. I checked the rod. The mark isn’t there.”

Councilor Len, of the Water Guild seat, entered quietly. He wore a gray robe with the guild’s glass ring pin at his collar. “Auditor,” he said, “I received your note. We can send a recalibration crew.”

“Recalibration won’t fix a missing sanction,” Nara said.

Len’s face remained blank. “If the sanction was not properly stamped, it doesn’t exist. That is the rule.”

“That rule starves families,” Vesh muttered.

Sil held up a hand. “The rule prevents chaos. Nara, we can issue a retroactive sanction. It will show on the rod tomorrow.”

“That solves yesterday. But the rods at the tower and the well differ by a half ring.” Nara pulled a folded strip of tracing from her satchel, showing the measurements. “Either someone tampered with the well rod or the tower rod.”

Len stepped closer, looked at the tracing. “The glass is sealed. Tampering would fracture it. There are no fractures.”

“Then explain the difference.”

Sil pressed her fingers to her temple. “We have a storm front coming. The snow line will drop. That’s our urgency. If you have a theory, bring it. Otherwise, we’ll accept your report and proceed.”

Nara felt a hot flare of frustration, like the sun at midday. She gathered her slate and stood. “I’ll bring a theory.”

As she turned, a clerk slipped in with a stack of new petitions. He avoided her eyes. Nara caught the faint smell of glue from the seals—freshly opened.

Outside, the sky had turned a clear blue. The wind carried the fine grit of the plateau, and she tasted it on her teeth. She walked to the guild annex with a single thought: the glass was telling a story, and someone was smudging its words.

## Chapter 4: The Glassworks

The glassworks sat at the edge of Ardent Cut, where the plateau dropped into the old quarry. The air here was a metallic heat, tinged with sulfur and charcoal. Furnaces glowed behind barred windows, and the hammering of mold makers rang like slow bells.

Nara found Master Etchren at a workbench, his goggles pushed up onto his head. He was carving a new tally rod, the rod’s surface catching light in trembling rainbows.

“Etchren,” Nara said, “I need to see the records of the last rods installed.”

He wiped his hands on a leather apron. “Auditor, you know the guild keeps those. I am only a maker.”

“You were a maker before the guild,” she replied. “And you hate their paperwork.”

He snorted. “You remember too much.”

He led her to a shelf of wooden boxes, each labeled with a date. He opened one and pulled a cloth-wrapped rod. “This went to the lower quarter five days ago. The one before went to the upper tower.”

Nara examined the rod. There were tiny, nearly invisible spirals etched into the surface. She ran a fingertip along one and felt a faint ridge. “These spirals weren’t on rods last year.”

“They’re a new calibration pattern,” Etchren said. “Allows the rod to hold a sanction mark without cracking. Len’s idea. He said the Council wanted more flexibility.”

“More flexibility,” Nara echoed.

“Look,” Etchren said, lowering his voice. “I don’t like it. The rods used to be honest. Now they can be nudged.”

“Nudged how?”

Etchren opened a drawer and pulled out a thin metal tool, shaped like a tuning fork with a rubber tip. “You set this at the spiral’s root, and you can shift a ring forward or back. The glass remains intact. No fracture.”

Nara felt her stomach tighten. “Why would you make a tool like that?”

“Guild commission. They said for repairs. To fix rods without replacing them.”

She took the tool, its metal cool and smooth. “Is there a record of who ordered these?”

Etchren shook his head. “They were delivered by Len’s runner. I kept one in case you’d ask.”

Nara pocketed it. The workshop heat made her eyes water. “I need to test the rods. If someone used this, the difference in rings can be explained.”

“And if someone did,” Etchren said, “don’t accuse the guild unless you’re ready to survive the fallout.”

She glanced at him. His face was lined with soot and old worry. “Someone is already suffering the fallout,” she said. “It just isn’t the guild.”

She left the glassworks with the tool and a throb in her temples. The quarry winds smelled of slag and dry grass. In the distance, the snow line on the mountain had shifted downward, a pale scar. The storm front was coming, and whoever controlled the tally would control the response.

## Chapter 5: The Hidden Reservoir

Nara waited until evening to visit the mid-terrace cistern. The cistern house was a long stone building with an iron hatch. As the sun slid behind the ridge, she slipped inside and closed the hatch, leaving the world in dim, watery light.

The cistern smelled of damp rock and algae. She could hear the faint lap of water below. She unfolded a small lantern, its wick already lit, and lowered it into the hatch. The light glowed greenish against the water’s surface.

She brought out Etchren’s tuning fork and the portable calibration kit she carried. The tally rod in the cistern cradle gleamed in the lantern light. She pressed the tuning fork against the spiral groove. The rod hummed and a ring shifted, sliding a fraction down the rod like ice breaking.

Nara jerked her hand back. The ring had moved with a whisper. She pressed again, moved it back. The rod looked unchanged, no fractures, no obvious evidence. She felt a cold sheen of sweat on her neck, despite the humid air.

Footsteps echoed overhead. She extinguished the lantern, stood still. The hatch creaked. A thin beam of light cut the darkness, and a man descended, carrying a metal box.

It was Len.

He opened the box, set down tools, and touched the tally rod. He inserted a tool like hers, but with a wider fork. He pressed, and the ring slid.

Nara stepped forward, the lantern flaring as she lit it. “Councilor Len.”

He startled, then straightened. “Auditor Quill. You shouldn’t be here.”

“Neither should you.”

His expression hardened. “I’m performing maintenance.”

“Maintenance?” She held up her tool. “You’re shifting rings.”

“Recalibrating to match actual draw.”

“Actual draw or desired draw?” Nara demanded. “You’re falsifying the tally.”

Len’s jaw clenched. “The tally is not a holy relic. It is a tool. We have a storm front. The upper terraces refuse to cut their allotments. If we enforce the tally strictly, riots will break. So we adjust. We smooth. We manage.”

“You decide who drinks.”

“I decide who survives.”

Nara took a step closer, her lantern swinging, casting shadows. “The lower quarter’s ring was shifted downward. You made them look like thieves.”

Len’s eyes flicked away. “Their petition was incomplete. The stamp was missing the council seal.”

“It was missing because your clerk left it blank.”

Len exhaled. “Auditor, you don’t understand the pressures.”

“I understand the numbers,” she said. “And the numbers are being bent.”

He closed his toolbox. “If you bring this to the Council, you’ll collapse trust. The tally is the only neutral thing in this city. If people believe it can be manipulated, we will have chaos.”

“Then maybe they should know,” Nara said quietly.

She took the metal tool and set it on the cistern edge. “I won’t keep your secret.”

Len’s face tightened. “Think of the storm.”

“I am.”

She left him in the dim cistern, climbed into the cooling night. The wind carried the smell of rain and dust. The storm was coming, and so was the reckoning.

## Chapter 6: The Storm Front

By morning, the sky had shifted to a heavy slate. The snow line on the mountain had fallen, and the air smelled of ozone and wet stone. Nara stood in the Council hall with her slate, the tuning fork tucked into her sleeve. Around the table, the councilors sat in tense silence.

Nara spoke. “The tally glass has been altered. I witnessed Councilor Len shifting rings at the mid-terrace cistern.”

Sil’s lips pressed into a thin line. Vesh’s eyes widened. Len remained still, his hands folded.

“That is a serious accusation,” Sil said.

“It is a fact,” Nara replied. “The rods now include spiral calibrations that allow rings to be moved without fracture. The glassworks built tools for it.”

Len lifted his chin. “I recalibrated to match actual draw, as the guild is authorized to do in emergency.”

“You changed the lower quarter’s rings without sanction,” Nara said. “You created a false record that will be used to deny them water.”

Vesh slammed his hand on the table. “Is this true?”

Len looked at him. “It is a calculation. We have a storm front. The upper terraces won’t reduce. If we keep the tally rigid, we lose half our reserves before the snowfall. I shifted to protect the reservoir.”

Sil leaned back. “The charter grants the guild authority to adjust in emergencies. We voted last winter.”

Nara felt her throat tighten. She hadn’t known. “You gave them that power without a public notice?”

“We needed flexibility,” Sil said. “The storm fronts are more erratic now. You of all people should know that.”

Nara’s slate trembled in her hand. “So the tally is not neutral. It’s a tool of the guild and the Council.”

“It has always been a tool,” Len said.

The room seemed to narrow. Nara could hear the wind rattling the window lattice. “Then you’ve built the city on a lie.”

Sil stood. “Auditor Quill, if you choose to make this public, you will incite panic.”

“I choose to tell the truth.”

Sil’s face hardened. “Then you will be removed from office.”

The words were a hammer. Nara’s breath caught. “You can’t remove me for doing my duty.”

“I can, and I will,” Sil said. “We cannot allow the tally to become a battlefield.”

Nara looked around the table. Vesh’s eyes were full of anger and worry, but he said nothing. Len watched her with a calm that felt like stone.

“Fine,” Nara said. She placed the tuning fork on the table. “Keep your tally. I’ll take the people.”

She left the hall as the first drops of rain struck the roof, a soft drumming that grew louder as she stepped outside. The storm front broke over Ardent Cut, and the city braced for the deluge and the hunger after.


## Chapter 7: The Pump House

The rain eased into a steady drizzle by the time Nara reached the pump house on the ridge. The building sat above the city like a squat guard, its walls of black stone darkened by wet. A wind vane creaked on the roof, and the air smelled of damp metal and pine carried from the high slopes. She wiped rain from her brow and pushed through the door.

Inside, the pump house was a cavern of pistons and gears. The great piston arm rose and fell in a slow, muscular rhythm, drawing meltwater from the snow line through a mesh intake. The sound was a deep thump followed by a sigh, like a giant breathing. Water ran down channels cut into the floor, disappearing into the main pipe. Steam fogged the windows, and the heat stuck to Nara’s skin.

Jori, the pump foreman, stood by a brass gauge with a wrench in hand. His beard was beaded with moisture. “Auditor,” he said, nodding. “You picked a wet day to visit.”

“I’m told the pressure is dropping,” Nara replied. She held out her slate. “The intake is clogging.”

Jori pointed to the gauge. The needle quivered below the green band. “Silt and seed husks. We cleared it twice this week. Something’s off upstream.”

Nara crouched by the intake grate, the metal slick beneath her fingers. She could hear the water roaring behind it, a steady rush that vibrated the frame. “If the intake drops too far, the upper reservoir will lose a ring. The Council will tighten allotments.”

Jori grunted. “They’ll tighten regardless. The guild sent word to cut pressure on the lower line.”

“They can’t do that without a notice,” Nara said.

“They can, and they will,” Jori said. He flicked his thumb toward a rack of tools: a pry bar, a net hook, a coil of rope. “You want to see what’s in the intake?”

Nara nodded. “We need to know.”

Jori motioned to two pump hands, both women with sleeves rolled and hair wrapped tight. They hooked the rope to the grate and braced themselves. The rope bit into their palms, and Nara felt the rough fibers against her skin as she took a position beside them. Jori counted with his hand, then yanked. The grate lifted with a groan, water gushing around the edges. A spray of cold droplets hit Nara’s face, sharp and clean.

From the mouth of the intake, a mass of tangled reeds and silt surged forward, catching on the grate. The pump hands hauled, their boots slipping on wet stone. Jori slid a metal bar under the grate and levered, his muscles straining. “Hold!” he shouted. “Keep it steady.”

Nara reached with the net hook, snagging the tangled mass. She pulled, and the mass came loose, revealing a cluster of seedpods wrapped in a strip of waxed cloth. She caught her breath. The cloth was stamped with a guild seal.

Jori saw it too. “That’s not from the river.”

Nara held the cloth up. The seal was recent, the wax still pliant. “Someone is stuffing the intake,” she said. “With guild supplies.”

The pump hands exchanged a look. One of them, Mira, wiped her brow with a sleeve. “If we report this, they’ll say we did it. We’re on the lower roster.”

Nara tucked the cloth into her satchel. “I will report it,” she said. “And I will name the seal.”

Jori blew out a breath. “Be careful. The guild doesn’t like its seals questioned.”

The pump thumped, a steady heartbeat. Nara watched the water run clear as the intake cleared. The gauge needle climbed slowly, a thin line of hope. “If the intake was sabotaged,” she said, “it explains the pressure drop and the panic. Someone wants the tally to show a shortage.”

Jori set the grate back into place. “We can watch the intake, but we can’t watch the ledger.” He looked at her. “That’s you.”

He led her to a narrow alcove where a chalkboard hung on the wall. The board was marked with dates and pressure lines, each line a thin white arc. Jori tapped the last week’s column. “See this dip? Two nights ago, right after the Council session. The pump should have held. Instead, it stuttered. We shut it down, cleared the intake, and it ran again. The silt we pulled was different, packed tight like it had been soaked and dried.”

Nara leaned closer. The chalk lines were uneven, a record of effort as much as measurement. She could smell the chalk dust, dry and sharp. “Someone prepped it,” she said. “Seed husks wouldn’t pack like that on their own.”

Jori nodded. “We thought it was a landslide at first. But the slope hasn’t moved. The snow line is lower, but not enough to dump this much.”

Mira stepped closer, holding a small cloth bundle. “We keep the samples,” she said. She unfolded the bundle to reveal a clump of dark silt with flecks of pale seed shell. “It smells like the guild’s storage houses,” she said. “Dry grain and oil.”

Nara touched the silt with a gloved finger. It was gritty and tacky. She pictured storage bins, the guild’s seal pressed into wax. “Then someone had to carry it up here.”

“We’ve been keeping watch at night,” Mira said. “We saw lights on the ridge. Two riders. They stayed out of range, but the glow was close enough to show lantern glass.”

Nara’s stomach tightened. “Did you report it?”

“To who?” Mira asked, her voice flat. “The guild controls the watch. We tell them, they say it was a patrol.”

Nara straightened, the hum of the pump in her ears. “You did the right thing keeping samples. Keep them safe. We might need proof.”

Jori grunted. “Proof doesn’t always matter.”

“It matters when you put it in front of everyone,” Nara said. “That’s the point of a public tally. We don’t fight rumors. We show facts.”

She took out her slate and copied the pressure lines. The chalk squeaked against the slate’s edge. “If the pressure dips again, send word to the lower quarter. We need to sync our counts to the pump.”

Jori nodded. “We can do that. But we’ll need a signal. The guild watches the main line.”

Nara looked at the large piston arm, its metal slick with condensation. “Then we use the old signal. The bell on the ridge.”

“The storm bell?” Jori asked.

“Yes. Three rings for a pressure drop. One for a clear run. It’s loud enough that the lower quarter can hear if the wind is right.”

He smiled, a small crease in his beard. “We haven’t rung that in years. People will think a landslide is coming.”

“They’ll come to the wells either way,” Nara said. “Better they come with warning.”


Outside, the drizzle had turned to mist. Nara stepped onto the slick stone, the cold air biting after the heat of the pump house. She heard the distant rumble of the city, the bells from the lower quarter, the muted rush of water in the main pipe. She held the waxed cloth in her hand like a sharp token.

On the ridge path, she met Rho climbing up, his cloak soaked. “The Council wants you,” he said, breathless. “They’re saying the lower quarter is drawing from the upper reserve through the old maintenance line.”

“The old line is sealed,” Nara said.

“Then someone unsealed it.”

Nara’s stomach tightened. The old line was a narrow artery, used only during floods. If it was open, the tally could be thrown off and the pressure would dip. “We need to check,” she said.

Rho glanced at the sky. “The trail will be mud.”

“Then we walk in mud.”

They headed along the ridge, the path slick and uneven. The smell of wet earth rose around them. The old maintenance line ran through a grove of wind-worn trees, their branches skeletal. The line’s hatch sat in the ground like a rusted eye. Nara brushed away the wet leaves and unlatched it, the metal cold in her palm.

Inside, the line was dark. She lowered her lantern, the flame flickering. The smell inside was old water and iron. She saw a trickle running along the pipe seam, a thin line that caught the lantern light. Someone had opened the valve recently; the handle was wet and the sealing wax was broken.

Rho whistled softly. “Who has access?”

“The guild, the Council, the valve tenders,” Nara said. “And anyone who steals a key.”

She examined the wax. The seal bore a partial imprint—a glass ring and a diagonal line. Not the Council’s, not the guild’s. It looked like a private stamp.

“Someone wants us to fight,” she said. “They’re making it look like the lower quarter is siphoning.”

Rho leaned on the hatch frame, rain dripping from his hair. “Who benefits from that?”

“Those who want the old order back,” Nara said. “If people fear each other, they won’t challenge the tally.”

She closed the hatch and resealed it with the spare wax she carried. The wax was warm from her pocket. As it cooled, it hardened into a dull, protective skin. “We need to show this to the Council,” she said. “And to the people.”

Rho shook his head. “The Council will deny it. And the people are already angry.”

“Then we show them the seal,” Nara said. “We show them the cloth. We show them the truth, even if it hurts.”

They turned back toward the city, the mist thick around them, the sound of water in the pipe a low, steady hum beneath their feet.

## Chapter 8: The Ledger Walk

Nara waited until the afternoon market quieted before she crossed into the upper terraces. The air there was cooler, scented with rosemary and baked bread. The homes were larger, their walls smoother, the doors painted with family symbols. She carried a satchel with the waxed cloth, the broken seal, and a new tally rod wrapped in linen. Ossa walked beside her, her headwrap damp from the mist.

“This part of the city always smells like oil,” Ossa murmured, looking at the gleaming pipes running along the wall. “They polish it like a mirror.”

“They don’t have to breathe the steam,” Nara said, nodding at the vent stacks that hissed faintly. The sound was a soft exhale, almost a whisper.

They stopped at a courtyard where a small fountain trickled into a basin. A woman was washing greens, the water running over her hands. Nara approached and waited until the woman looked up. “We are doing a public tally,” she said. “Would you like to see?”

The woman’s eyes narrowed. “I heard you tampered with the rods.”

“We replaced them,” Nara said. She held up the wrapped rod. “This is the new rod. No spirals. No guild marks.”

The woman glanced at it, then at Ossa. “Why should I trust you?”

“Because we are counting the same water you use,” Ossa said. “If we lie, you will see it in your faucet tomorrow.”

The woman hesitated, then nodded toward the fountain. “Count that, then.”

Nara set the rod in the fountain’s cradle, marking the first ring as the woman filled her basin. The rod chimed, a clear note that made the woman pause. A man in a blue coat wandered over, curious. He watched the ring form, his brow furrowed.

“It’s strange,” he said. “Hearing the sound. The guild’s rods are silent.”

“Because they’re sealed,” Nara said. “The sound tells you if the glass is under stress.”

He touched the rod, then pulled his hand back as if surprised by its coldness. “If the guild can change the rings, what does that mean for my allotment?”

“It means your number might not be your number,” Nara said. “That’s why we’re doing this.”

He nodded slowly. “If the Council lied, they’ll say you’re lying now.”

“Then we make our counting visible,” Ossa said. She gestured toward the market. “Come to the lower quarter. Bring your own basin if you want. We’ll count together.”

The man glanced toward his home, then back at the rod. “I will.”

As he left, a girl of about twelve hovered near the fountain, her hands wrapped around a ceramic cup. “Will the tally change what we get?” she asked, her voice small. Her hair was damp with mist, and she wore a scarf mended with a strip of blue cloth.

Nara knelt to meet her gaze. “It will change how we count,” she said. “If the count is honest, the Council will have to answer for their numbers. That means you’ll know why your cup is full or why it’s not.”

The girl glanced at the rod. “My father says numbers are just words.”

“Numbers are also promises,” Nara said. She pointed to the rod’s ring. “That line means a bucket someone can drink. If someone moves it, they move a promise.”

The girl touched the cold glass with a fingertip and shivered. “It’s colder than the water.”

“It remembers,” Ossa said softly. “Glass holds what it sees.”

A teacher in a worn coat approached, her hands clasped around a bundle of notes. “Auditor,” she said, “my students are frightened. They’ve heard that the lower quarter is taking water from the school cistern. They’re angry. They don’t understand.”

Nara straightened. “Bring them to the tally. Let them watch the count. We can show them where the water goes.”

The teacher glanced toward the fountain, where the children gathered. “They learn best by touching,” she said. “But their parents won’t let them go near the lower quarter.”

“Then we bring the tally to them,” Nara said. She lifted the rod, feeling its weight. “We can do a count here for the school cistern. It will show them that the lower quarter doesn’t steal. The water moves along the pipe. The number is the same no matter whose hands draw it.”

The teacher nodded, relieved. “If you do that, I’ll stand with you. The parents listen to us when we stand together.”

They carried the rod to the school cistern, a low stone well with a carved lid. The lid was cool and damp. Nara lifted it, and the smell of clean water rose, sharp and mineral. A thin chain clinked as a bucket was lowered. The children crowded close, their shoes scraping on the stone.

Nara marked the first ring as the bucket filled. She let the children hear the chime, the clear tone that echoed off the school walls. A boy reached to touch the rod, and Nara guided his hand. “Feel it,” she said. “That sound is your water.”

The boy’s eyes widened. “It’s like a bell.”

“It is a bell,” Ossa said. “A bell that you can hold.”

The teacher watched, her face easing. “If they remember this,” she said, “it will be harder to turn them into a crowd.”

Nara slid the rod back into its wrap. The linen was damp from the air, and the glass had chilled it. She felt the weight of the rod like a responsibility. “That’s the hope,” she said.

They moved through the upper terraces, repeating the ritual at each public fountain. Some people turned away, but others stopped, watched, and asked questions. Nara answered patiently, her voice hoarse by the fourth fountain. She showed them the waxed cloth from the pump intake, the broken seal from the maintenance line.

“This was used to choke the intake,” she said. “It’s a guild seal. Someone is trying to make the tally show a shortage.”

A woman with a child on her hip frowned. “The guild wouldn’t do that.”

“Someone with a guild seal did,” Nara said. “You can choose to ignore it, but the water doesn’t.”

By the time they reached the upper reservoir gate, a small procession had formed behind them: a baker, a teacher, a tinker with grease-stained hands. The guard at the gate shifted uneasily. “This is a restricted area,” he said.

“We’re not entering,” Nara said. “We’re counting from the outside.”

She set the rod on the reservoir’s public draw, where gardeners filled cans for the terraces. The gardeners watched with curiosity. One of them, an older man with soil under his nails, leaned in. “You’re brave,” he said quietly. “Or foolish.”

“Both,” Nara replied.

As they counted, Len’s clerk arrived, breathless, a ledger tucked under his arm. “Auditor Quill,” he said, “the Council has ordered you to cease.”

Nara looked at him. “On what authority?”

“On the authority of the charter. The guild controls tallying.”

Nara held up the broken seal. “The charter was altered. The tally was altered. That authority is compromised.”

The clerk’s face reddened. “You’re inflaming the city.”

“The city is already burning,” Ossa said. “We are showing where the smoke comes from.”

The clerk glanced at the procession behind them. His grip tightened on the ledger. “If you continue, the Council will cut the lower line.”

“Then the upper line will be the only line,” Nara said. “Do you want that responsibility on your ledger?”

He hesitated. The guard at the gate shifted again, the metal of his spear tapping the stone. The sound echoed like a dull bell. The clerk opened his mouth, then closed it. He turned and walked away, the ledger pressed against his chest like a shield.

When they reached the edge of the upper terrace, Nara paused and looked over the city. The lower quarter’s roofs glistened with rain, and the copper bell by the well caught the last light. She felt the weight of the rod in her hands, the faint vibrations of water passing through it. The open tally was no longer just a rebellion; it was a chain of witness stretching across the terraces.

Ossa touched her arm. “They’re listening,” she said.

Nara nodded. “Now we need to keep the truth from drowning.”


## Chapter 9: The Lower Assembly

The storm lasted three days. Sheets of rain hammered the terraces and the lower quarter’s roofs, filling the gutters and swelling the cisterns. The city smelled of wet clay and lightning. At the end of the third day, a cold sun rose, and the Council posted new allotments in the market square.

Nara stood by the notice board as people gathered. She watched their faces as they read the smaller numbers, the reductions focused on the lower quarter and the kiln districts. A murmur grew into a low rumble. A man with a cracked knuckle tore down a notice and crumpled it in his fist.

Nara climbed the steps of the old amphitheater in the lower quarter, the stone slick with rain. She held up her slate and cleared her throat. “I have something to tell you,” she said. Her voice carried across the stone, across the crowd.

The woman with the scarred forearm—Ossa, she had learned her name—stood in front. “Tell us,” Ossa said.

“The tally glass has been altered,” Nara said. “The rings can be shifted without fracture. The guild and the Council can change the record.”

A murmur, then a shout. “Lies!” someone called. “The tally is the only truth.”

“It was,” Nara said. She held up the tuning fork. “This is what they use. I saw it.”

Ossa took the tool, turned it in her hands. The metal gleamed. “So our extra draw was erased.”

“Yes.”

The crowd’s voices rose, a tide of anger and fear. Nara felt it like heat against her skin. She lifted her hand. “Listen. The storm depleted the upper reservoirs. The Council will blame the lower quarter. They’ll say you stole.”

“And what do we do?” a man called.

“We demand open tallies. We demand a public count.”

“From who?” Ossa asked. “They fired you.”

Nara’s throat tightened. “I’ll count with you. We’ll make a tally outside the guild.”

Ossa’s gaze sharpened. “A public tally? With what glass?”

Nara looked at the amphitheater’s stone steps, worn from years of gatherings. “With any glass that will hold a ring. We can make our own rods. The guild can’t stop us all.”

A young woman in a yellow scarf stepped forward. “My mother works the glassworks. She can show us the molds.”

A chorus of voices surged, some angry, some hopeful. Nara could hear the creak of wet wood, the drip of water from eaves, the pounding of her own heart.

Ossa raised the tuning fork. “If we do this,” she said, “we’ll be declaring the Council unfit. They’ll cut us off.”

“They already have,” Nara said.

The crowd fell silent. Then Ossa nodded. “We gather tonight. We make our own tally.”

Nara stepped down from the amphitheater. Her legs shook with the effort, with the weight of the choice. She had turned the tally into a battlefield. Now she had to keep it from becoming a war.

## Chapter 10: The Open Glass

That night, the lower quarter gathered in the old kiln yard. The kilns were cold now, their mouths dark, but their walls still held heat from days of firing. People brought bottles, jars, any glass they could find. The air smelled of ash and wet clay. A bonfire crackled, its light flickering across faces.

Etchren arrived with a crate of molds. He set them down and wiped his brow. “I shouldn’t be here,” he said, but his eyes were bright.

Nara knelt by a low table where a young woman named Tali arranged the molds. Tali’s hands moved with practiced ease, and she had a smudge of soot on her cheek. “We’ll need sand,” Tali said. “Clean sand. The quarry dust will cloud.”

“We have river sand,” Ossa said, hauling a sack. “It’s damp.”

“Then we dry it.” Tali poured the sand into a metal pan, placed it near the fire. The heat rose, sharp and dry. Nara felt it on her face.

They worked through the night. The furnace heated, the sand melted, and the glass glowed like captured sunlight. The sound of the bellows was a low roar. Nara blew into a pipe, her cheeks aching as the glass swelled. She set it into a mold. When it cooled, a rod emerged, imperfect but clear.

Etchren traced a spiral into the rod. “You want the calibration mark?” he asked.

“No,” Nara said. “No spirals. We keep it honest. If it fractures, it fractures.”

He nodded, and instead etched three straight lines to mark the first measures. “We need to mark it so we can read it. We’ll use charcoal, then engrave once it sets.”

At dawn, they carried the new rods to the wells. The sky was pale, the air cold and damp. People lined up, watching. Nara took the old rod from the cradle and replaced it with the new one. The glass chimed, a clear, true sound.

“There,” she said. “We start fresh.”

A man with a gray beard stepped forward. “What if the guild comes and takes it?”

“Then we make another,” Nara said. “And another.”

They began the count. Each bucket filled, each ring marked. Nara wrote the numbers on a slate and read them aloud. The tally became a public ritual. Children passed chalk between each other. Someone hung a copper bell beside the well and struck it after each tenth measure. The sound rolled through the quarter like a pulse.

By midday, the Council sent a messenger. He wore the guild pin but no robe, his face lined with worry. “Auditor,” he said. “The Council requests you return. They will reconsider.”

Nara wiped soot from her hands. “Tell them I am here. This is the tally now.”

The messenger looked at the crowd, at the new rods. He swallowed. “They will cut your supply line.”

“They can try,” Ossa said.

Nara felt a flicker of fear, then a steadier resolve. The tally was no longer a closed thing. It was a shared act. The storm had washed away the old trust, and now they were building a new one from melted sand.

## Chapter 11: The Cut Line

The Council’s answer came at dusk. A convoy of guild enforcers marched down the main road, their boots striking stone in unison. They carried iron wrenches and the heavy wheel for the main valve. Nara stood in the well yard, the new tally rod gleaming in the fading light.

Len walked at the front. His expression was tight, his eyes fixed on the valve house. “Stand aside,” he called. “We’re closing the lower intake until order is restored.”

Ossa stepped forward. “Order is restored. Our tally is public.”

“It’s illegal,” Len said. “The charter grants the guild sole authority over the rods.”

“The charter was amended without notice,” Nara said. “We never consented.”

Len’s jaw worked. “Then the Council will address that in time. For now, we preserve the reservoir.”

Nara raised the tuning fork. “You preserve control.”

The enforcers reached the valve house. Nara moved to block the door. She could smell the sweat of the men behind her, the oil on their tools. The air was cool, but her palms were hot.

Len looked at her. “If you resist, you’ll be arrested.”

“Then arrest me,” she said.

An enforcer stepped forward, his hand on her arm. Before he could grasp her, a child’s voice rang out. “Wait!” The boy with the pebble ran up, holding a bucket above his head. The bucket sloshed, water spilling down his arm. “This is my sister’s water. If you close the valve, you close her throat.”

For a moment, Len hesitated. The boy’s bucket glinted, the water catching the last light. The sound of a bell from the well yard broke the silence.

Ossa lifted a copper bell and rang it again. The sound rolled, then others joined, striking pots, lids, anything that could ring. The air filled with clanging, a chorus that drowned out the enforcers’ boots.

Vesh appeared at the edge of the crowd, his ink-stained hands raised. “Len,” he shouted over the noise, “stop. The Council is split. We can’t do this.”

Len looked back. His eyes were hard, but there was a fracture of uncertainty. He lowered his hand. “Stand down,” he ordered the enforcers.

They hesitated, then stepped back. The clanging slowly faded, leaving only the wind and the breath of the crowd. Nara felt her knees go weak. She leaned against the valve house, the stone cold at her back.

Len walked closer, his voice low. “You’ve forced our hand. This won’t end well.”

“It ends with water,” Nara said. “And a tally no one can shift.”

He turned and walked away. The enforcers followed, their boots a fading rhythm. The lower quarter exhaled in a long, shaky breath.

## Chapter 12: The Broken Glass

The next morning, the upper terraces woke to empty taps. Someone had closed the secondary valve overnight, redirecting water to the lower quarter. Nara learned of it when Rho arrived, his face pale, his tea cup shaking in his hand.

“It wasn’t me,” Nara said before he could speak. “I didn’t touch the valves.”

“I know,” Rho said, his eyes wide. “But they think you did. The upper quarter is furious. They’ve barricaded the Council hall.”

Nara felt a cold knot in her stomach. “Who closed the valve?”

Rho shook his head. “Somebody with a guild key. Len’s men are blaming you.”

Nara thought of the tuning fork, of the open tally. The act of closing the valve was a signal, a cut meant to force negotiation or provoke violence. Either way, it would be blamed on her.

She went to the Council hall. The square was crowded, people shouting, their breath clouding in the cold. Someone had lit a torch, and its smoke curled into the gray sky. The air smelled of pitch and wet wool.

Sil stood on the steps, flanked by guards. “We will restore flow,” she called. “But order must be maintained.”

Nara pushed through the crowd to Vesh. “Who closed the valve?”

Vesh’s eyes were tired. “Not us. Len swears it wasn’t the guild. I think someone from the upper terraces did it to make a point.”

“So they could blame the lower quarter,” Nara said.

Vesh nodded. “They want you out. They want the open tally to fail.”

Nara looked at the square, at the divided faces. She saw Ossa in the distance, holding the copper bell, her jaw clenched. She saw Rho standing by the valve house, hands in his pockets.

She stepped onto a crate and raised her voice. “Listen!” she shouted. “The lower quarter did not close the valve. The tally is public. If someone wants to move rings, they must do it in the light. If someone wants to close a valve, they must do it in the light.”

“Then who did it?” someone yelled.

“Someone who wants us divided,” Nara said. “We cannot let them win.”

A stone struck the ground near her. A man with a red scarf shouted, “The lower quarter stole our water!”

Ossa rang the bell once. The sound cut through the noise. “We didn’t steal. We counted,” she called. “Come to our well. See our tally. See the rings.”

There was a pause, the crowd’s anger held by the bell’s vibration. A woman stepped forward, clutching an empty jug. “I’ll go,” she said. “I want to see.”

Others followed. The crowd shifted, a slow tide. Nara felt the tension ease a fraction. The open tally was not only for the lower quarter now. It could be a bridge or a battleground, depending on who stepped onto it.

## Chapter 13: The New Measure

By evening, people from all terraces had gathered around the lower well. They watched as Nara and Ossa counted the day’s draw. The rod was now half-ringed, its marks clean and honest. Children passed chalk, marking numbers on a board. The copper bell rang after each tenth measure, its sound carrying over the roofs.

Len arrived with a small group of guild clerks. He watched the count, his face unreadable. When the last bucket was tallied, he stepped forward. “The Council has agreed to an audit,” he said. “A public audit.”

Nara felt a flicker of relief. “With what rods?”

“With yours,” Len said. “And ours. We will compare.”

Sil appeared behind him, her hair damp from mist. “We will open the Council hall for a citizen assembly,” she said. “The charter will be reviewed. The guild’s authority will be revised.”

Murmurs rose. Nara looked at Vesh, who nodded once, a tired smile tugging at his mouth.

Len met Nara’s gaze. “You have won this fight, Auditor. But understand what you have broken. The tally was a symbol. Without it, people will argue over every measure.”

“Then we learn to argue,” Nara said. “In public.”

Before the assembly convened, the audit began in the open square. Two tables were set side by side: one with the guild’s spiraled rods, one with the kiln yard rods from the lower quarter. Clerks from both sides brought ledgers, their pages fanned like hands. The air was sharp with the smell of lamp oil and wet stone. People gathered in a loose ring, each holding a jar or cup, each waiting to see which tally would claim their water.

Nara stood between the tables, her slate tucked under her arm. “We count the same draw twice,” she said. “No adjustments. No private marks. If the rings differ, we mark the difference and we say why.”

Len’s clerk nodded stiffly. The guild rods were colder to the touch, their spirals catching the lamplight. The kiln rods were warmer, their straight lines duller but steadier. A woman from the upper terraces stepped forward with a brass kettle that shone like gold. She filled it at the public draw, the water steam curling. Nara marked the ring on the kiln rod. The guild clerk marked the ring on his rod. The rings matched, and a murmur of approval rippled through the crowd.

Then Ossa filled a dented tin bucket from the lower quarter’s well. The guild rod’s ring landed half a line lower than Nara’s. The crowd stirred. “Explain,” someone called.

Len’s clerk swallowed. “The guild rod accounts for line loss,” he said. “The lower quarter draws are far from the main intake.”

“Line loss is a rate, not a correction after the fact,” Nara replied. “If you account for it, you do it before the count. You don’t lower the ring.”

The man in the blue coat from the fountain stepped forward. “So we’ve been paying for loss twice?” he asked.

“It appears so,” Vesh said, his voice firm. He dipped his finger in the water and shook it off. “This is why we need the audit. The numbers must be transparent.”

The teacher from the school cistern stepped forward next. “My students tracked their draw,” she said, holding up a slate filled with neat rows. “Their count matches the open rod.”

The crowd grew more vocal, not in anger but in the way of people finding their voices. Nara felt the tension shift into something like focus. The audit wasn’t just about numbers; it was about trust being rebuilt in small, visible acts.

By the time the last of the day’s draws were counted, the guild rods and the kiln rods had diverged by enough to make the difference undeniable. Len stared at the lines, his jaw tight. “This will require recalibration,” he said.

“And a public record of how you did it,” Nara said.

He nodded once. “Agreed.” The word sounded like a concession and a surrender.

That night, the assembly met under oil lamps. The hall smelled of wax and damp stone. People spoke, their voices echoing, their words weighed as carefully as water. The charter was read aloud. The amendment granting the guild emergency power was challenged. The Council voted to repeal it, to create a citizen panel to oversee any future adjustments.

Nara sat in the back, her slate on her knees. She listened to the sounds of agreement, the occasional scrape of a chair, the murmur of dissent. A child slept on a bench, their head resting on a jar. The jar’s glass caught the lamplight, a small, steady glow.

She thought of the spiral grooves Etchren had carved and the tuning fork in her pocket. The glass could be made to lie, but only if people stopped watching. Maybe the new tally would be a constant effort, a ritual of vigilance. It felt heavy, and yet she felt lighter than she had in months.

## Chapter 14: The New Ring

The first snow fell a week later. It dusted the terraces in white and softened the edges of the stone. Nara stood at the upper valve tower again, her breath a pale plume, her fingers numbed by cold. Below, the city moved in quiet lines to the wells, each step leaving prints in the snow.

She held a new tally rod, made from the kiln yard molds. It was clear, unspiraled, marked only by straight lines and the etched emblem of the city—a circle of hands, newly chosen. She slid it into the cradle. The glass chimed, a clear, honest note.

Rho stood beside her, his patched sleeves pulled tight. “You’re no longer Auditor,” he said. “What do we call you now?”

“Nothing,” Nara said. “Or just Nara.”

He nodded. “The citizen panel asked for your help. They want you to teach.”

She smiled, the cold biting her cheeks. “I can teach.”

They watched the first draw of the day. A woman filled her jug, steam rising from the warm water into the cold air. The ring formed on the rod, a thin milky line. Rho rang the tower bell, and its sound rolled down the terraces, answered by the copper bell in the lower quarter.

Later that morning, Nara stood in the annex with a dozen apprentices, their notebooks balanced on their knees. She held a small shard of glass in her palm, its edge wrapped in cloth. “The tally isn’t just the ring,” she said. “It’s the habit. You listen, you measure, you speak. If you don’t speak, the ring can be moved and no one will notice.”

One apprentice, the boy from the maintenance hatch, raised his hand. “What if the Council asks us to change the ring again?”

“Then you say no,” Nara said. “And you write down that you said no. You tell the citizen panel. You ring the bell.” She tapped the shard against the table, a bright ping that made several of them smile.

She handed the shard to the next apprentice, watching as they felt the cold edge. The room smelled of chalk and wet wool. Outside, the city’s sounds carried through the open window: the clatter of carts, the hiss of vents, the faint laughter of children at the well. Nara felt the rhythm of those sounds settle in her chest. The tally was no longer a solitary weight. It was an echo shared by many voices.

When the lesson ended, the apprentices filed out, and the boy lingered. He placed the shard on the table with care. “I used to think the tower was the only place that mattered,” he said. “Now the well matters too.” Nara nodded. “Every well matters,” she said. She looked at his ink-smudged fingertips and felt a quiet assurance that the counting would continue even when she wasn’t there.

Nara felt the rhythm of the city change. The tally was no longer a secret held by a few. It was a public act, a shared measure. There would be arguments, mistakes, and new petitions. There would be storms. But there was also a new normal: a city that counted its water with open hands.

She turned toward the mountain. The snow line glowed pink in the morning light. The water would come, slowly, in rings of glass. She had chosen the truth, and the city had chosen to share it. The ring held, and the day began.

FIN.
