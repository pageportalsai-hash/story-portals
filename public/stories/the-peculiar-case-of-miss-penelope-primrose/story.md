The Peculiar Case of Miss Penelope Primrose

**Chapter 1**

The name Penelope Primrose tasted like sugared almonds and sounded like a lie. A beautiful, necessary lie. The real her, Polly Perkins, tasted more like backstage dust and lukewarm tea, and sounded like the frantic shuffling of a trick deck of cards.

Penelope adjusted the ridiculously tiny hat perched atop her elaborate coiffure, its single peacock feather threatening to poke out the eye of a passing dowager. London, in the throes of a damp May afternoon, was a symphony of overwhelming sensations. The clip-clop of a thousand horseshoes on cobblestone, the cloying scent of horse manure and expensive perfume warring for dominance in the thick air, the press of bodies draped in wool and silk—it was a far cry from the shadowy back rooms and drafty music halls she had once called home.

Her new home, a townhouse on Eaton Square bequeathed to her by the late, great, and profoundly eccentric spiritualist, Madame Vaudeline, was a gilded cage of terrifying proportions. Polly—no, *Penelope*—had been Madame’s assistant, the unseen hand that rattled tables, the spectral whisper from behind a velvet curtain, the architect of ghostly apparitions. Madame, a woman with a flair for the dramatic and a surprising fondness for her quick-witted apprentice, had left Penelope her entire fortune.

There was, of course, a catch. There was always a catch.

The solicitor, a man with a face like a dried apple, had read the will with morbid glee. “The sum total of my estate, a considerable fortune, I leave to my dear Penelope, on one condition: that within one year of my passing, she prove herself a woman of true standing. She must be accepted into polite society and secure a marriage proposal from a gentleman of impeccable reputation.”

Failure meant the fortune went to a home for incontinent cats, and Penelope would be back to faking contact with Great-Aunt Mildred for a shilling. The stakes were, to put it mildly, as high as the plume on her hat.

And so, here she was, at her first authentic high-society tea, hosted by the most terrifying creature she had yet encountered: Lady Augusta Fitzwilliam. Lady Augusta was the undisputed gatekeeper of the London season, a woman whose approval could make a duchess and whose scorn could unmake a dynasty. She possessed a nose built for sniffing out impropriety and eyes that seemed to peer directly into one's soul, or, in Penelope’s case, one’s thoroughly fabricated backstory.

“Miss Primrose,” Lady Augusta said, her voice a crisp rustle of starched linen. “We are all so intrigued by your arrival. So… sudden.”

Penelope offered a smile she hoped looked demure and not like a grimace of pure panic. “My guardian, Madame Vaudeline, preferred a quiet life, Lady Augusta. Her passing was, as you say, sudden. I am merely following her wishes that I finally emerge into the world.”

This was a half-truth, which her former employer always said was the most effective kind of lie.

“Madame Vaudeline,” another lady chirped, her face a constellation of powdered wrinkles. “The spiritualist! How deliciously macabre. Did you ever… commune with the other side yourself, my dear?”

Penelope’s heart did a frantic clog dance against her ribs. This was the precipice. One wrong word and she’d tumble. “Madame Vaudeline believed I possessed a certain… sensitivity. An openness to the ethereal vibrations of the world.” She chose her words carefully, phrases plucked directly from Madame’s own professional vocabulary.

Lady Augusta’s eyes narrowed. “Indeed. A sensitivity. How… convenient.”

The air crackled with unspoken judgment. Penelope felt sweat begin to gather at her hairline. She was an imposter, a music hall trickster playing a lady, and she was about to be found out on her very first outing. She needed a distraction, a classic misdirection. Her eyes darted around the room, landing on a young woman fanning herself rather vigorously near the French doors—Beatrice Blackwood, whom she’d been briefly introduced to. Perfect.

“Oh, Miss Blackwood,” Penelope called out, her voice pitched with practiced concern. “You look a touch wan. The air in here is so frightfully thick, is it not? I find myself sensing a great wave of… of…” she paused, letting the silence hang, “…floral distress. The lilies, I believe. They are simply crying out for fresh air.”

It was utter nonsense, but it was delivered with the unwavering confidence of a seasoned performer. Several ladies glanced nervously at the vase of lilies as if expecting them to faint.

Beatrice Blackwood, a girl with bright, curious eyes and an easy smile, giggled. “Floral distress! I’ve never heard it put quite that way. But you are right, it is rather stuffy.”

The distraction worked, turning the conversation from Penelope’s dubious spiritual talents to the less treacherous topic of ventilation. Penelope allowed herself a minuscule sigh of relief. This was just another stage, the audience more discerning and the consequences of a bad performance far more severe.

It was then that he walked in.

He entered not with a flourish, but with the weary resignation of a man attending his own execution. He was tall, dressed in a somber but impeccably tailored suit of charcoal grey that seemed to absorb the light around him. His hair was the colour of midnight, and his jaw was set in a line so firm it could have been carved from granite. He was, Penelope noted with a professional’s eye for detail, aggressively handsome. And aggressively miserable.

“Alistair, darling!” Beatrice chirped, her entire demeanour brightening. “You came!”

“It was this or listen to another of Father’s lectures on agricultural drainage,” the man grumbled, his voice a low, resonant baritone that sent an unwelcome shiver down Penelope’s spine. He paused, his gaze sweeping the room with an air of profound boredom, before it landed, with unnerving precision, on Penelope.

His eyes were the colour of storm clouds, grey and intelligent and utterly devoid of frivolity. They held hers for a fraction of a second too long, a silent interrogation that made her feel as though her corset were a size too small.

Beatrice, oblivious, clapped her hands. “Alistair, you simply must meet our newest addition to the season. This is Miss Penelope Primrose. Miss Primrose, my brother, Viscount Blackwood.”

Lord Alistair Blackwood. The name echoed in her memory from the solicitor's list of “gentlemen of impeccable reputation.” He was, in fact, at the very top of it.

He gave a stiff, formal bow that was a masterpiece of reluctance. “Miss Primrose.”

“Lord Blackwood,” Penelope replied, sinking into a curtsy.

His eyes remained on her, a slight, almost imperceptible frown creasing the space between his brows. It was the look of a man presented with a puzzle he had no interest in solving, but whose existence nonetheless irritated him.

“My sister tells me you are a new arrival,” he stated, his tone flat.

“That is correct, my lord. I am quite… fresh.” The word sounded absurd as soon as it left her lips.

A corner of his mouth twitched, not quite a smile, but an acknowledgment of her odd choice of words. “Fresh,” he repeated, as if tasting it. “And you were just discussing… floral distress?”

Penelope’s cheeks warmed. Of all the things for him to have overheard. “A mere observation, my lord. One must be attuned to the subtle energies of one’s environment.”

Lord Blackwood’s expression didn't change, but Penelope felt the atmosphere around him cool several degrees. “Subtle energies,” he said slowly, the words dripping with skepticism. “You mean like heat and light? Or are we dabbling in the more… theatrical sciences?”

She was being tested. By the one man she couldn’t afford to fail with. Her entire future, her fortune, her escape from a life of deception, depended on convincing a man like this that she was a respectable lady. And this walking monolith of cynicism had her pegged as a fraud in under thirty seconds.

This, she thought with a dreadful, sinking feeling, was going to be much, much harder than she’d ever imagined.

**Chapter 2**

The Blackwood Ball was less a social gathering and more a gladiatorial arena draped in silk and lit by a thousand twinkling candles. Women sized each other up over the rims of champagne glasses, their smiles as sharp as their corsetry. Men postured and preened, assessing dowries and lineages with the cold calculus of livestock auctioneers. For Penelope, it was the Colosseum, and she’d forgotten her shield.

Her gown, a confection of pale lavender silk that had cost an eye-watering sum, felt like a costume. The pearls at her throat felt like a noose. Every smile was a performance, every polite inquiry a potential trap. She had spent the week since Lady Augusta’s tea party practicing. She’d read Burke’s Peerage until her eyes crossed, memorizing dukes and earls like she once memorized the tarot. She’d practiced her curtsy until her knees ached. She was prepared. In theory.

In practice, her heart hammered against her ribs like a trapped bird.

“You look enchanting, Miss Primrose!” Beatrice Blackwood appeared at her side, a vision in rose-pink. “Is it not splendid?”

“It is certainly… loud,” Penelope said, shouting slightly over the string quartet’s valiant but losing battle against the din of high society.

“Oh, that’s just the sound of everyone trying to impress everyone else,” Beatrice said with a conspiratorial wink. “Pay it no mind. The key is to look utterly bored. It suggests you’ve seen it all before.”

This was advice Penelope could not possibly follow. Her eyes were wide, taking in the spectacle. It was a masterclass in illusion. The candlelight was forgiving, smoothing wrinkles and hiding desperation. The champagne was a social lubricant, loosening tongues and inhibitions. It was all a grand, expensive piece of theatre, and for the first time, she felt a flicker not of fear, but of professional appreciation.

Her brief moment of calm was shattered by the reappearance of Beatrice’s brother. Lord Blackwood materialized from the throng of guests like a thundercloud on a sunny day.

“Beatrice, Father wishes to know if you’ve seen Lord Ashworth. He wants to discuss crop rotation.” Alistair’s voice was dry as dust.

“Tell Father that Lord Ashworth is currently trying to impress Miss Finsbury with his knowledge of Italian poetry and would likely consider crop rotation a fatal blow to his romantic ambitions,” Beatrice chirped. She then beamed at Penelope. “Alistair, you have not yet danced with Miss Primrose.”

It was not a suggestion; it was a command.

Alistair looked as though his sister had just asked him to waltz with a porcupine. “I am certain Miss Primrose’s dance card is quite full,” he said, a hopeful note in his voice.

“Nonsense. She has been saving a space for you,” Beatrice declared, blissfully ignoring the silent, frantic signals Penelope was trying to send her.

Trapped. There was no polite way out. With a sigh that clearly conveyed his deep suffering, Lord Blackwood extended a gloved hand. “Miss Primrose. If I must.”

“You honour me, my lord,” Penelope murmured, placing her own hand in his. His grip was firm, his hand cool even through the leather. The contact sent another one of those disconcerting jolts through her system. It was like touching a live wire.

He led her onto the dance floor as the orchestra struck up a waltz. He was, to her immense surprise and irritation, a superb dancer. He moved with a confident, masculine grace that belied his grumpy demeanour, guiding her through the intricate steps with an effortless precision. It was infuriating.

“You seem to be surviving the evening, Miss Primrose,” he said, his voice a low rumble near her ear. “I confess I am surprised. You did not strike me as the ballroom type.”

“And what type did I strike you as, my lord?” Penelope asked, her chin held high.

“The type to find all of this,” he made a vague gesture with his head, “an exercise in ostentatious absurdity.”

He wasn’t wrong. But admitting it would be disastrous. “I find it quite… beautiful. A tapestry of human connection.” She nearly choked on the saccharine phrase.

“A tapestry woven with threads of ambition and greed,” he countered smoothly. “Tell me, Miss Primrose, what ‘subtle energies’ are you sensing tonight? Besides desperation, of course. That one is practically a roar.”

He was baiting her again, trying to poke holes in her carefully constructed facade. Two could play at that game. Polly Perkins had never backed down from a challenge.

She leaned in slightly, lowering her voice to a confidential murmur. “Very well, my lord. If you insist.” She let her gaze drift over his shoulder to a portly gentleman sweating profusely as he spoke to a young lady. “See that man? Lord Hemlock. He projects an aura of profound confidence, does he not? Discussing his vast shipping interests, I’d wager.”

Alistair glanced over. “That is common knowledge.”

“Ah, but is it common knowledge,” Penelope continued, her voice dropping further, “that the real energy he is radiating is sheer, unadulterated panic? His left hand, you see. He keeps touching his waistcoat pocket. A nervous tic. He’s checking for something. A letter, perhaps? One he shouldn’t have? And his gaze keeps flicking towards the entrance. He is not trying to impress the girl; he is watching for the arrival of her father, to whom he owes a rather staggering sum of money. The girl is not a romantic prospect; she is collateral.”

She had no idea if any of it were true. It was a classic cold reading, a technique Madame Vaudeline had perfected. Observe, deduce, and deliver with absolute certainty.

Alistair was silent for several steps. She felt his hand tighten fractionally on hers. He guided her through a turn, and she saw his eyes, narrowed and thoughtful, studying Lord Hemlock.

“How could you possibly know that?” he asked, his voice losing some of its mocking edge and gaining a note of genuine curiosity.

“As I said, my lord. A sensitivity.” She gave him a mysterious smile.

He scrutinized her face, his storm-grey eyes searching for the trick. “Or a prodigious talent for gossip.”

“Gossip is merely the mundane expression of spiritual truth,” she said, quoting Madame Vaudeline directly.

A slow, reluctant smile finally touched Lord Blackwood’s lips. It was a startling transformation, chasing the shadows from his face and revealing a devastatingly handsome man. “That is the most absurd, pseudoscientific nonsense I have ever heard.”

“And yet,” Penelope pressed, feeling a heady rush of victory, “you are not entirely certain I am wrong, are you?”

The music swelled to a close. He held her for a moment longer than was strictly necessary, his gaze locked with hers. The air between them was no longer cool with skepticism, but warm and charged with something else entirely. Something complex and dangerous.

“No, Miss Primrose,” he said softly, his voice a low vibration she felt all the way to her toes. “I am not.”

He escorted her back to the edge of the dance floor, gave another one of his stiff bows, and disappeared into the crowd without another word, leaving Penelope with a racing heart and the distinct feeling that she had just won a battle, but was now in much deeper peril than ever before. She had wanted to secure a proposal from a man of good standing. She had not, under any circumstances, planned on actually starting to like him.

**Chapter 3**

The week following the Blackwood Ball was a flurry of calling cards and invitations. Penelope Primrose, it seemed, was a success. Her mysterious air, coupled with her supposed spiritual sensitivity—and, she suspected, the sheer jaw-dropping size of her inherited fortune—had made her the curiosity of the season. Ladies invited her to tea, hoping she would 'sense' something interesting about their rivals. Gentlemen flocked to her side, their eyes gleaming with a mixture of romantic and financial interest.

It was exhausting. Maintaining the persona of Penelope Primrose required constant, draining vigilance. She had to remember which fork to use for fish, how to address a dowager countess versus a marchioness, and to suppress her very un-ladylike urge to shuffle a deck of cards whenever her hands were idle.

Her only respite was Beatrice Blackwood, who had attached herself to Penelope with the cheerful tenacity of a barnacle.

“A walk in Hyde Park is essential for one’s constitution,” Beatrice announced, appearing at Penelope’s door a few days later, her face glowing with health and conspiracy. “And it is the best place for observing the species in its natural habitat.”

Penelope, who would have preferred to spend the afternoon in her sitting room with a pot of tea and a sensation novel, found herself bundled into a carriage and deposited at the edge of the park. The air was soft and smelled of damp earth and blooming roses. Nurses pushed prams along the winding paths, and couples strolled arm-in-arm beneath the shade of the great plane trees.

“Now,” Beatrice began, her voice low and strategic, “the key to a successful season is to be seen, but to appear as if you are entirely indifferent to being seen. It is a very fine line.”

“Like walking a tightrope,” Penelope murmured, the analogy coming more naturally than she would have liked.

“Precisely! And speaking of things that require a delicate balance…” Beatrice trailed off, her gaze fixed on a point ahead. “Oh, what an astonishing coincidence.”

Penelope followed her gaze. Leaning against a tree, staring moodily into the placid waters of the Serpentine, was Lord Alistair Blackwood. There was nothing coincidental about his presence; Beatrice had the triumphant air of a general whose ambush had just been successfully sprung.

“Alistair!” she called, waving with an enthusiasm that was entirely too bright.

He turned, and the familiar look of weary resignation settled on his features. “Beatrice. And Miss Primrose. Am I to have no peace?”

“Nonsense, you love our company,” Beatrice declared breezily. “We were just discussing the finer points of society. Miss Primrose finds it all a fascinating anthropological study.”

Alistair raised a skeptical eyebrow in Penelope’s direction. “Does she, now? I thought she was more concerned with the metaphysical plane than the merely anthropological.”

“A true student of the world concerns herself with all its layers, my lord,” Penelope said smoothly, recovering her composure. “The seen and the unseen are but two sides of the same coin.”

“I prefer my coins to have two seen sides, thank you. It makes them easier to spend.” He pushed himself off the tree and fell into step beside them, his long-legged stride forcing Penelope to walk a little faster.

Beatrice, her matchmaking mission apparently accomplished, suddenly remembered a pressing engagement. “Oh, heavens, is that the time? I promised Mama I would help her with the seating chart for her dinner party. It is a matter of grave diplomatic importance. You two will be quite alright without me, I am sure!” And with a wave, she was gone, practically skipping down the path.

An awkward silence descended, broken only by the chirping of sparrows and the distant laughter of children. Penelope searched for a safe topic. The weather? Too boring. Politics? Too dangerous. Spiritual vibrations? Absolutely not.

“Your sister is a terrible liar,” Alistair said, breaking the silence.

Penelope couldn’t help but smile. “She does lack a certain subtlety.”

“She gets it from our mother. She believes the best way to get what she wants is to simply bulldoze a path toward it.” He glanced at her, a hint of amusement in his eyes. “It’s a trait I imagine you might find familiar.”

“I have no idea what you mean, my lord,” Penelope said, her face a mask of innocence.

“Oh, I think you do. You may be more subtle than Beatrice, Miss Primrose, but you are no less determined. I saw you at the ball. You work a room like a general commanding a battlefield.”

This was dangerously close to the truth. He saw her as a strategist, a performer. He saw Polly. “A lady must be mistress of her own drawing room, my lord. Or so I have been told.”

“And do you always do as you are told?”

The question was quiet, but it landed with surprising weight. Did she? No. She had spent her entire life doing the exact opposite. She had listened at keyholes, learned from tricksters and charlatans, and forged her own path in the shadows.

“I believe,” she said carefully, “in listening to good advice. And then making up my own mind.”

He nodded slowly, as if she had confirmed something he already suspected. They walked on in a more comfortable silence. The pretense and the verbal sparring seemed to melt away under the gentle May sunshine. For the first time, she wasn’t performing for him, and he wasn’t interrogating her.

“Why do you dislike it so much?” she asked, genuinely curious. “Society, I mean. The balls, the teas. All of it.”

He was quiet for so long she thought he wouldn’t answer. “When I was younger,” he began, his voice low and devoid of its usual sardonic edge, “my father invested a great deal of money with a man everyone believed to be a genius. A visionary. He was charming, witty, the toast of London. He spoke of new technologies, of investments that would change the world. It was all a lie. A grand performance. He vanished overnight, and he took half of my father’s fortune with him.”

Penelope’s breath caught in her throat. The story was uncomfortably familiar.

“I learned then,” Alistair continued, his gaze fixed on the horizon, “that the most polished surfaces often hide the most rot. I have no patience for performance, Miss Primrose. I value truth. Reality. Things that can be measured and proven.”

A cold dread washed over her. He was explaining, in the most eloquent and painful way possible, why he was the absolute worst person in the world for her. His entire worldview was built on a foundation of despising people like her. People like Polly Perkins.

And yet, here in the quiet of the park, she found herself wanting, more than anything, for him to see her, the real her, and not be disappointed. It was a terrifying, illogical, and deeply inconvenient desire.

“I am sorry that happened to your family,” she said softly. It was all she could offer. The lie she was living felt heavy and sour in her mouth.

He shrugged, as if shaking off the past. “It was a long time ago. An expensive lesson.” He stopped and turned to her, his expression unreadable. “You are not at all what I expected, Miss Primrose.”

“No?” she whispered.

“No,” he said, his voice dropping again to that low, resonant frequency that made her stomach flutter. “You are far more interesting.”

He was standing closer than was strictly proper. She could see the flecks of a darker grey in his stormy eyes, the faint lines of concentration etched around them. She could smell the clean, masculine scent of his wool coat and something else, something uniquely him. And in that moment, the carefully constructed plan to marry for fortune felt like a hollow, lonely thing.

The mission had just become hopelessly, disastrously complicated. She wasn’t just playing a part to win over a stranger anymore. She was lying to a man she was beginning to care for, a man who prized truth above all else. And she knew, with the chilling certainty of a prophecy, that the truth would destroy everything.

**Chapter 4**

The whispers started as a low hum and grew into a persistent buzz, like a fly trapped in a jam jar. Penelope Primrose was too mysterious. Her past was a blank page. Where had she really come from? Who was this Madame Vaudeline? The initial curiosity that had made her a novelty began to curdle into suspicion. Lady Augusta Fitzwilliam, Penelope was certain, was the queen bee orchestrating the entire hive.

Penelope would enter a room and conversations would halt, replaced by the flutter of fans and furtive glances. At a luncheon, a woman with a face like a startled pug asked, “Miss Primrose, you have such a remarkable way with words. One might almost think you were… practiced.”

The implication hung in the air: practiced like an actress. Practiced like a fraud.

Penelope smiled, a serene mask hiding the frantic calculations whirring in her mind. “Madame Vaudeline was a great believer in elocution, Mrs. Pumble. She used to say that a well-turned phrase is a gift to one’s listeners.”

It was a constant, exhausting performance. She felt like a juggler trying to keep a dozen priceless, fragile vases in the air at once. One slip, and everything would come crashing down.

Her only anchor in this swirling sea of suspicion was, ironically, the family of the greatest skeptic she knew. Beatrice was a staunch and vocal defender, dismissing the rumors with a wave of her hand as “the pathetic mewling of jealous cats.” And Alistair… Alistair was a puzzle.

He continued to seek her out, his presence a dark, solid shape in the pastel froth of the London season. He would appear at her side during a promenade, or corner her in a library during a country house weekend. Their conversations were a strange dance of witty antagonism and unexpected sincerity. He would mock her “ethereal vibrations” one moment, and then ask her a searching, deeply personal question the next.

One afternoon, at a dreadfully dull musicale, Penelope found herself cornered by Lady Augusta and her circle of cronies.

“Miss Primrose,” Lady Augusta began, her voice dripping with faux sweetness, “we were just discussing inheritances. It is so fascinating how wealth can… appear from the most unexpected of places.”

“Indeed,” Penelope replied, her hand tightening on her teacup. “Fortune, like the spirit world, moves in mysterious ways.”

“Quite,” Augusta said, her eyes glinting. “Almost… magically.”

The word hung in the air, sharp and pointed. It was a direct hit. Penelope’s carefully constructed composure began to fray. She could feel the stares of the other women, the predatory gleam in their eyes. They smelled blood in the water.

“Magic, Lady Augusta?” A low, drawling voice interjected. “I thought we had left such superstitions behind with leeching and alchemy.”

Alistair Blackwood stepped into their circle, positioning himself slightly in front of Penelope, a subtle but unmistakable gesture of shielding. He took a cup of tea from a passing footman, his movements unhurried and deliberate.

Lady Augusta looked momentarily flustered. “Lord Blackwood! We were merely having a fanciful chat with Miss Primrose.”

“It sounded less like a chat and more like an interrogation,” Alistair said coolly, his gaze sweeping over the assembled women. “And on a subject—magic—that I, as a man of science, find profoundly tedious. Surely there are more rational topics for a sunny afternoon? The dismal state of the new rose hybrids in the botanical gardens, for instance. Or the alarming spread of dry rot in the West Wing of the palace. Anything, in fact, that actually exists.”

The directness of his speech, his utter dismissal of their line of inquiry, was like a bucket of cold water. The women murmured excuses and quickly dispersed, leaving Penelope and Alistair standing alone near a wilting fern.

Penelope let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. “Thank you, my lord.”

“I did not do it for you,” he said brusquely, not looking at her. “I did it because I cannot abide foolish women talking about foolish things. Their collective lack of logic is an affront to reason.”

But Penelope saw the lie. She saw the ghost of a protective instinct in the set of his shoulders, in the way his eyes had scanned their faces for threats. He had defended her. The man who despised everything she represented had just become her unwitting champion.

“Whatever your reasons,” she said softly, “I am grateful.”

He turned to her then, his expression dark and conflicted. “They will not stop, you know. Augusta has the tenacity of a terrier with a rat. She believes you are hiding something, and she will not rest until she uncovers it.”

“Let her look,” Penelope said, forcing a confidence she did not feel. “She will find nothing.”

“Will she not?” His grey eyes searched hers, and for a terrifying moment, she thought he could see everything—the backstage rooms, the trick cards, the girl named Polly. “Everyone has secrets, Miss Primrose. The key is whether they are the sort that can unravel a life.”

The intimacy of his warning, the quiet gravity in his voice, struck her more than Lady Augusta’s open hostility. He was not accusing her; he was cautioning her. It felt like an alliance, a strange, unspoken partnership forged between the skeptic and the mystic.

“My life is quite… simple, my lord,” she lied, the word feeling like ash in her mouth.

He held her gaze for a long moment. “I don’t believe that for a second,” he said, his voice a low murmur. “And that, against my better judgment, is what I find so damned compelling.”

He turned and walked away, leaving her standing by the fern, her heart a tangled mess of gratitude, fear, and a burgeoning affection that was growing more impossible to ignore with each passing day.

The stakes of her charade had shifted. It was no longer just about the money. Now, she had something far more precious to lose: the grudging respect and burgeoning interest of the one man she was most determined, and most terrified, to deceive. The line between Penelope Primrose, the aspiring lady, and Polly Perkins, the clever performer, was beginning to blur. And she had a sinking feeling that when it finally vanished, Alistair Blackwood would be standing right there to witness it.

**Chapter 5**

Lady Augusta Fitzwilliam was not a woman who accepted defeat. Being publicly rebuked by Lord Blackwood had not extinguished her suspicion; it had fanned it into a bonfire. If direct assault failed, she would resort to cunning. And in Victorian London, there was no form of cunning more fashionable than an appeal to the supernatural.

The invitation arrived on a thick cream card, the calligraphy as sharp and severe as the sender. ‘Lady Augusta Fitzwilliam requests the pleasure of Miss Penelope Primrose’s company for an intimate dinner.’

“Intimate dinner,” Penelope muttered to her reflection, “is society parlance for ‘public execution’.”

Beatrice, who had delivered the invitation herself and was now lounging on Penelope’s chaise longue, giggled. “Oh, it won’t be that bad. Augusta’s cook is divine. And besides, Alistair is going. He says he has an obligation to ‘observe the predator in her natural habitat’.”

“He means your aunt,” Penelope clarified.

“Of course! Who else?” Beatrice said. “You’ll be fine. Just smile, look mysterious, and if anyone asks you to commune with their dead poodle, politely decline.”

But it was not fine. The moment Penelope stepped into Lady Augusta’s drawing room, she knew she had walked into a trap. The guest list was small and carefully curated. There was the pug-faced Mrs. Pumble, a flighty Baroness known for her belief in fairies, and, to Penelope’s horror, Mr. Abernathy, a well-known member of the Society for Psychical Research. And, of course, there was Alistair, standing by the fireplace, his expression darker than a funeral wreath. He caught her eye and gave a subtle, almost imperceptible shake of his head. A warning.

Dinner was a carefully orchestrated inquisition. Every question was a baited hook.

“Miss Primrose,” Mr. Abernathy began, peering at her over his spectacles, “I was so fascinated to hear of your connection to the late Madame Vaudeline. She was a figure of great interest to us. Her methods were… unorthodox, but her results were often quite startling.”

“Madame was a woman of great and singular talent,” Penelope said, choosing a piece of asparagus with painstaking care.

“Indeed,” Lady Augusta purred, leaning forward. “So many of my friends have spoken of your own… sensitivities. Your ability to perceive things others cannot.”

Here it comes, Penelope thought. The spring of the trap.

“It is a small, unbidden thing, Lady Augusta. A feeling. A fleeting impression.”

“Oh, I think it is more than that,” Augusta said, her smile widening. “In fact, I believe we are in the presence of a true gift. Which is why I was hoping you might indulge us. After dinner.”

The room went quiet. Even the footmen seemed to hold their breath.

“Indulge you?” Penelope asked, her voice dangerously steady.

“A seance,” Lady Augusta announced, her eyes glittering with triumph. “Just a small one. My dear departed grandmother, Eloise, had a fondness for this house. I feel her presence so strongly at times. I thought perhaps, with your unique abilities, you could help us make… contact.”

It was a nightmare. A checkmate. If Penelope refused, it would be a tacit admission of fraud. It would confirm every suspicion, every rumor. Lady Augusta would have her victory. But if she agreed… if she agreed, she would have to perform. She would have to become Polly Perkins again, to dredge up all the old tricks and deceptions in a room that included a psychical researcher and, worst of all, Alistair Blackwood, the man who viscerally hated everything she was about to do.

Her mind raced, searching for an escape. There was none. She was cornered.

She looked across the table at Alistair. His face was a mask of cold fury, his jaw tight. He was furious at his aunt for her manipulative cruelty, but he was also watching Penelope, waiting. This was the ultimate test. Would she prove his cynicism right?

To fail the test meant losing the fortune and returning to a life of shilling-seances and drafty boarding houses. To pass the test meant becoming a liar in front of the one person whose opinion had started to matter more than the money.

She took a slow, deliberate sip of water. The choice was agonizing, but in the end, there was no choice at all. Polly Perkins was, above all else, a survivor.

Penelope placed her glass down with a soft click. She looked directly at Lady Augusta, her expression one of solemn, reluctant acceptance.

“Lady Augusta,” she said, her voice dropping to a low, resonant pitch—the one she always used just before the lights went down. “It is not something I undertake lightly. Contacting the other side can be… draining. And occasionally, unpredictable. But I sense a great yearning in this room. A spirit that wishes to be heard.”

It was all nonsense, of course. Theatrics. But it was what they wanted to hear.

The Baroness gasped. Mr. Abernathy leaned forward, his eyes gleaming. Lady Augusta looked like the cat who had not just gotten the cream, but the entire dairy.

Penelope’s gaze found Alistair’s again. His face was unreadable, carved from stone. But his eyes… his eyes held a flicker of something she couldn’t name. It wasn’t anger. It wasn’t mockery. It looked, to her profound shock, like disappointment.

This was the midpoint. The turning point. Her carefully laid plan to simply be a quiet, dignified lady was in ruins. To save her new life, she would have to fully embrace her old one. She had to put on the greatest performance of her career, for the most difficult audience imaginable.

“Very well,” Penelope said, her voice a soft, somber whisper that carried to every corner of the silent room. “After dinner, we shall see who is waiting for us… on the other side.”

The air grew thick with anticipation and dread. Penelope felt a chilling certainty that the spirit she was about to channel was not Lady Augusta’s grandmother, but her own impending doom.

**Chapter 6**

Panic was a cold, sharp-toothed thing, and it was currently chewing on Penelope’s insides. A seance. Here. Now. Without her props, without her comfortable darkness, without Madame Vaudeline running interference. It was like asking a tightrope walker to perform over a pit of vipers during an earthquake.

As the ladies retired to the drawing room, leaving the gentlemen to their port, Penelope excused herself, claiming a sudden headache and the need for a moment of fresh air. It was a lie, of course. She needed a moment to think. To scheme.

She found herself in a small, dimly lit study off the main hall. Bookshelves lined the walls, filled with leather-bound volumes. A heavy velvet curtain covered the window. It smelled of old paper and beeswax. It was a perfect, small stage.

*Think, Polly, think,* she commanded herself. *What would Madame do?*

Madame would say that a true artist works with the materials at hand.

Her eyes scanned the room. A heavy oak desk. A fireplace with a poker and tongs. A bell-pull for the servants. A vase of slightly wilted roses. Her mind, trained for years in the art of illusion, began to work.

The table was too heavy to rattle convincingly. But the floorboards… she pressed down with her heel near the desk. A faint but discernible creak. Not ideal, but usable.

The bell-pull. She gave it a gentle tug. A faint jingle echoed from somewhere deep in the house. A ‘spirit bell’. Excellent.

The fireplace. A draft. She held her hand near the flue. A cold current of air snaked down. If she could position someone near it, they would feel a ‘spirit’s touch.’

It was a flimsy, pathetic collection of tricks. It would never fool Abernathy, and it certainly wouldn't fool Alistair. She needed something more. She needed an accomplice.

Her mind immediately went to the one person in the house who was her ally, however unwittingly. Beatrice. But could she trust her? Could she risk revealing even a part of her secret? The answer was no. It was too dangerous.

But then, a memory surfaced. Beatrice at the ball, whispering conspiratorially. Beatrice in the park, springing her gentle ambush. Beatrice was romantic, yes, but she was also clever, and she was profoundly, deliciously bored.

A new plan, audacious and wildly risky, began to form in Penelope’s mind. She didn't need to confess. She needed to recruit.

She found Beatrice in the drawing-room, looking anxious. “Penelope! Are you alright? You look pale.”

“I need your help,” Penelope whispered, pulling her into an alcove. “The spirit world… it is a volatile place. The auras in that dining room were very… conflicted. Especially Lady Augusta’s.”

Beatrice’s eyes widened. “Conflicted how?”

“She desires contact, but her skepticism is like a lead shield. It blocks the weaker vibrations. It can even anger the spirits,” Penelope improvised, a thrill running through her. This was what she was good at. Weaving a story. “I need a believer in the room. A conduit. Someone with a pure, open heart to help draw the spirit forward.”

Beatrice was hooked. “Me?” she breathed.

“Yes. Listen carefully.” Penelope laid out her plan, framing it in the language of spiritualism. “When I call for silence, you must concentrate with all your might on Grandmother Eloise. I will position you near the fireplace. You may feel a cold spot. That is the spirit drawing energy from you. Do not be alarmed.”

“A cold spot,” Beatrice repeated, awed.

“And,” Penelope added, playing her ace, “sometimes a spirit needs a familiar sound to find its way. A sound from its past. Lady Augusta mentioned her grandmother was fond of this house. Did she have a handbell, perhaps?”

“No, but she loved the little chime of the servant’s bell in the study! She said it was like a fairy’s laugh,” Beatrice supplied eagerly.

Penelope could have kissed her. “Perfect. At a key moment, when the energy is at its peak, I may need you to… help amplify the connection. The spirit may not have the strength to ring the bell itself, but it may be able to guide a willing, living hand.” She locked eyes with Beatrice. “Do you understand?”

A slow smile spread across Beatrice’s face. She understood perfectly. She wasn’t being asked to help a fraud; she was being invited to participate in a spooky, exciting game against her formidable aunt.

“I understand completely,” she said, her eyes dancing with mischief.

When the gentlemen finally joined them, the atmosphere in the drawing room was thick with anticipation. Lady Augusta directed them to the small study. “I feel this room is where she is strongest.”

Penelope arranged the seating. Lady Augusta, Mr. Abernathy, and the Baroness at the heavy oak desk. She placed Beatrice’s chair near the fireplace, slightly away from the others. And then Alistair entered the room.

“I will stand,” he announced, positioning himself against the far wall, his arms crossed. His expression was grim. He was here as a witness for the prosecution.

Penelope took her place at the head of the table. She closed her eyes for a moment, not to summon spirits, but to summon Polly Perkins. The confident, charismatic performer who could hold an audience in the palm of her hand.

She began, her voice low and hypnotic. “We are gathered here to reach across the veil. To listen for a voice from the silent land. Let us clear our minds of doubt and suspicion. Let us be open.”

She subtly pressed her heel on the creaky floorboard. A faint groan echoed in the room. The Baroness gasped.

“The connection is weak,” Penelope murmured. “The spirit is hesitant. She needs more energy.” She glanced towards Beatrice. “She is drawing warmth. Does anyone feel a chill?”

“I do!” Beatrice exclaimed, right on cue. “My hands are freezing!”

Mr. Abernathy scribbled furiously in a small notebook.

“She is close,” Penelope whispered. “I can feel her… a presence… a name… El… Eloise?”

Lady Augusta leaned forward, her face a mask of rapt attention. “Yes! That’s her! Ask her for a sign! A sign that she is here!”

This was it. The moment for the bell. Penelope focused her gaze on the corner where the bell-pull hung, hidden in the deep shadows. She poured all her years of theatrical training into a look of intense, psychic concentration. Nothing happened.

A full ten seconds passed. The silence was deafening. Mr. Abernathy looked up from his notepad, his expression skeptical. Lady Augusta’s triumphant smile began to fade. Alistair, she knew without looking, was watching, judging.

Her plan had failed. Beatrice had lost her nerve. The whole charade was about to collapse.

And then, from the corner of the room, came a faint, clear *jingle*.

Beatrice hadn’t pulled the cord. She couldn’t have from her seat. Penelope hadn’t touched it. A real, unaccountable sound had just occurred.

Then came a scrape, a soft thud, and a startled, distinctly un-spiritual “*Meeeoow!*”

The spell was broken. A footman rushed in and turned up the lamps. There, by the bell-pull, looking thoroughly indignant, was Lady Augusta’s enormous, fluffy white Persian cat, who had apparently been investigating what looked like a rather tempting new toy.

The room erupted. The Baroness shrieked that the cat was a spirit medium. Mr. Abernathy looked bewildered. Lady Augusta was mortified.

And Alistair Blackwood, leaning against the wall, threw back his head and laughed. It was not a small chuckle, but a deep, genuine, unrestrained laugh that filled the small room. He laughed until tears pricked the corners of his eyes.

He caught Penelope’s gaze across the chaos. She had failed spectacularly to produce a convincing ghost. She had been saved by a cat. She should have been humiliated. Instead, seeing the raw, unfeigned amusement on Alistair’s face, she felt a dizzying, inappropriate sense of triumph.

The seance was a disaster. But somewhere in the midst of the farce, something had shifted. The skeptic had laughed. And Penelope realised, with a jolt, that he wasn't laughing at her. He was laughing *with* her. And that was far more dangerous than any spirit she could have pretended to summon.

**Chapter 7**

The disastrous seance became the talk of London, but not in the way Lady Augusta had intended. It was not a story of Penelope Primrose’s exposure as a fraud, but a comical anecdote about a mischievous cat and a flustered hostess. Penelope, far from being ruined, was seen as a good sport who had handled the farcical situation with grace and humour. She had, through sheer dumb luck, won the round.

But the incident had changed something, fundamentally, between her and Alistair. The wall of his skepticism had been breached, not by psychic phenomena, but by shared absurdity. He no longer looked at her as a problem to be solved, but with a new, unsettling warmth in his eyes.

He began to invent transparently flimsy excuses to see her. A book he thought she might find ‘intellectually stimulating’ (a dense tome on geology). A question about a 'distant cousin' who believed in table-rapping. It was clumsy and endearing and it made Penelope’s heart ache with the weight of her deceit.

One afternoon, he appeared at her townhouse unannounced, holding a small, lopsided bouquet of wildflowers. “These were…growing,” he said, thrusting them at her as if they were a proclamation of war. “Near the road. I thought they might…liven the place up.”

Penelope accepted the small, wilting posies as if they were the crown jewels. “They’re lovely, my lord. Thank you.”

“Alistair,” he corrected, his gaze intense. “My name is Alistair.”

“Penelope,” she replied, her voice barely a whisper. The use of his given name felt like crossing a line, stepping off a cliff into uncharted territory.

He followed her into the sitting room, prowling the space with a restless energy. “The seance,” he said suddenly, coming to a halt in front of the fireplace. “It was a masterclass in manipulation.”

Penelope’s stomach plummeted. “I… I don’t know what you mean.”

“Don’t you?” He turned to her, and his lips were curved in a wry smile. “The creaking floorboard. Directing my sister to the ‘cold spot’ by the drafty flue. The power of suggestion. It was brilliantly done. You play your audience like a virtuoso.”

He knew. He’d seen through all of it. This was it. The confrontation. The end.

“I was merely the vessel,” she began, falling back on her flimsy script.

“Stop,” he said, his voice gentle but firm. He took a step closer. “Stop performing, Penelope. At least with me.” He wasn’t angry. He was… intrigued. “You had everything planned. The only thing you didn’t account for was Augusta’s gluttonous feline.”

She couldn’t maintain the lie under his direct, knowing gaze. A shaky laugh escaped her. “He was not part of the program, no.”

“The bell,” he pressed, his eyes full of scientific curiosity. “That was the cat, obviously. But just before that. The jingle. I heard it. And I was watching the cat. It wasn’t him. It wasn’t Beatrice. It wasn’t you. What was it?”

Penelope frowned in confusion. “What jingle? The only sound was the cat tangling with the bell-pull.”

“No,” Alistair insisted. “Before that. A small, single, clear chime. Distinct. I was watching that corner of the room. Nothing moved. But I heard it.”

She stared at him. He wasn’t mocking her. He was genuinely perplexed, appealing to her as a fellow observer of a strange phenomenon. They were two logicians trying to solve a puzzle. The irony was so thick she could have sliced it. She had no explanation. She hadn’t faked it, and she hadn’t heard it.

“I… I don’t know,” she admitted, the truth a strange relief. “I didn’t hear anything.”

He studied her face, searching for guile, and seemed to find none. “Curious,” he murmured, more to himself than to her.

He let the subject drop, but the atmosphere in the room had shifted. The last barrier of pretense between them had dissolved. He knew she was a performer, an illusionist of some kind, and he was not horrified. He was fascinated.

“You are a walking contradiction,” he said, taking another step closer. They were standing so near now she could see the tiny lines fanning from the corners of his eyes, the dark stubble shadowing his jaw. “You speak of auras and vibrations, yet you have one of the most logical, observant minds I’ve ever encountered.”

“Perhaps the two are not mutually exclusive,” she whispered, her breath catching in her throat.

“Perhaps,” he conceded. His gaze dropped to her lips. The air grew thick and heavy, charged with a voltage that had nothing to do with spirits. The world seemed to shrink until it contained only the space between them.

This was no longer about a fortune, or a lie, or a contract. This was about the undeniable, terrifying pull between a man who craved truth and a woman who had built her life on lies. He was going to kiss her. She knew it with the same certainty that she knew her own name was Polly.

And she wanted him to. More than she had ever wanted the money.

He leaned in, his hand coming up to gently cup her jaw. His thumb stroked her cheek, a touch that was both a question and a statement. Her eyes fluttered shut. She could feel the warmth of his breath, smell the scent of wind and wool from his coat.

The sharp, insistent ringing of the doorbell shattered the moment.

It was impossibly loud, a brutal intrusion from the outside world. They sprang apart as if electrocuted. Alistair swore under his breath, a low, frustrated sound. Penelope’s heart was hammering so hard she thought it might break free of her chest.

Her butler appeared in the doorway, his expression apologetic. “A thousand pardons, Miss Primrose. A messenger has arrived. For you.” He held out a silver tray, upon which sat a single, grubby-looking envelope.

Penelope took it, her hands trembling. It was not the thick, creamy stationery of her new life. It was cheap, thin paper, folded hastily. Her name was scrawled on the front in a hand she had not seen in over a year, but which she recognized instantly.

A cold wave of dread, far more chilling than any faked spiritual draft, washed over her. She knew who it was from before she even broke the seal.

Alistair was watching her, his brow furrowed in concern. “Penelope? Is something wrong?”

She couldn’t speak. She tore open the envelope. The note inside was short, the handwriting a messy scrawl.

*Polly,*

*Heard you’ve come into a bit of luck. Landed on your feet in a big way. Don’t forget your old friends. I’m in a spot of bother. Need to see you. The old place. Midnight.*

*Jack.*

Smiling Jack. A sleight-of-hand artist, card sharp, and small-time con man she had worked with in her former life. A man who knew every single one of her secrets. A man who was utterly, irredeemably untrustworthy.

The carefully constructed world of Penelope Primrose shuddered on its foundations. The past she had tried so hard to bury had just reached out a grimy hand to pull her back in.

“Penelope?” Alistair repeated, his voice sharp with worry.

She looked up at him, at his handsome, concerned face, at the man who valued truth above all else. The almost-kiss, the fragile, beautiful thing that had been blooming between them, withered and died.

“It’s nothing,” she lied, her voice brittle. “Just… a bill.”

He knew it was a lie. She could see it in his eyes. The openness, the warmth of a moment ago, was gone, replaced by a flicker of the old suspicion. The wall was going back up, brick by painful brick. And she was the one rebuilding it.

**Chapter 8**

The “old place” was a dingy pub called The Fox and Fiddle, nestled in a grimy back alley of Seven Dials. It smelled of stale beer, wet wool, and desperation. This was Polly Perkins’s world, not Penelope Primrose’s. Swapping her silk gown for a drab grey travelling cloak and a plain bonnet felt less like a disguise and more like shedding a skin.

She slipped through the door just before midnight. The air was thick with smoke and raucous laughter. A man with a spectacularly mangled nose was playing a lament on a fiddle in the corner. No one gave her a second glance. Here, she was invisible in a way she never was in Mayfair.

Smiling Jack was in a back booth, nursing a pint of ale. He hadn’t aged well. The charming grin that had earned him his name was still there, but it was frayed at the edges. New lines of worry were carved around his eyes, and his suit, once dashing, was now shiny with wear.

“Polly, my little ghost,” he said, his smile widening as she slid onto the bench opposite him. “Or should I say, Miss Penelope Primrose? You look like a duchess.”

“What do you want, Jack?” Penelope asked, her voice low and hard. There was no room for pleasantries.

“Is that any way to greet an old friend? We pulled some fine tricks together, you and I.” He took a long swallow of his ale. “I hear old Vaudeline left you everything. Sitting on a mountain of gold, are we?”

“The terms of the will are complicated,” she said evasively.

“Not so complicated you can’t afford those pearls I saw you wearing in the society pages,” he countered, his eyes sharp. “Look, Polly, I’ll be straight with you. I’m in a hole. A deep one. A card game went south. I owe money to a man who doesn’t take kindly to being owed money.”

“That sounds like a personal problem, Jack.”

“It becomes your problem,” he said, his smile vanishing, “if I start talking. If I start telling folks about Mystica Polly, the girl who could make tables dance and spirits rap. If I mention how you learned to spot a mark a mile away, how you could read a man’s tells just by the way he held his teacup.” He leaned forward. “You think your fine lord, Blackwood, would be interested in that story?”

The mention of Alistair’s name was a physical blow. Jack had done his homework. A cold fury, sharp and clean, cut through her fear.

“Are you threatening me?”

“I’m offering you an investment opportunity,” Jack said smoothly. “You help me out of my little jam, and I disappear. I forget I ever knew a girl named Polly Perkins. I need five hundred pounds.”

Five hundred pounds. It was a staggering sum, more money than Polly Perkins had ever seen in one place. But for Penelope Primrose, it was attainable. Manageable. The price of silence.

“Fine,” she said through gritted teeth. “I’ll get it for you. But this is a one-time payment, Jack. You come near me or my life again, and you’ll discover that rattling tables wasn’t the only useful thing I learned from Madame Vaudeline.” It was a bluff, but a good one. Jack looked momentarily unsettled.

“Meet me here, two nights from now. Same time,” he said, recovering his swagger. “A pleasure doing business with you, Miss Primrose.” He drained his pint and sauntered out, leaving Penelope alone in the smoky gloom.

The journey back to Eaton Square was a blur of self-recrimination. She had been so close. So close to securing her future, so close to something real and tangible with Alistair. Now, the past had her in its grip again, blackmailing her with the truth.

She had to get the money, and quickly. But withdrawing such a large sum would raise questions with the solicitor who managed her funds. She needed a believable reason. A large, respectable purchase.

Her eyes fell on a catalogue from a Bond Street jeweller that had arrived that morning. An idea, distasteful but necessary, formed in her mind. She would ‘buy’ a diamond necklace, take the cash instead of the jewellery from a less-than-scrupulous jeweller she knew of from her old life, and pay Jack off. It was risky, but it was the only way.

The next day was an exercise in torment. Alistair called on her, his manner reserved, his eyes clouded with the suspicion she had reignited.

“You received some… troubling news yesterday,” he stated, dispensing with any preamble.

“It was a reminder of an old debt,” she said, the half-truth tasting bitter.

“A debt you seem unable to speak of.” His voice was flat, devoid of the warmth she had grown accustomed to. “Penelope, I… I thought we were past this. I do not care what secrets you have. I only care that you feel you cannot trust me with them.”

Her heart fractured. He was offering her exactly what she craved—his trust, his acceptance—and she had to throw it back in his face. To tell him the truth now would be to put him in an impossible position. He would know about the blackmail. His rigid sense of justice would compel him to act, to confront Jack, and the whole sordid story would come spilling out, ruining everything. Paying Jack off was the only way to contain the damage.

“It is my burden to bear alone, Alistair,” she said, her voice sounding thin and brittle to her own ears. “Please, do not press me on it.”

The hurt in his eyes was a physical pain. He saw her closing herself off, pushing him away, and he interpreted it as rejection.

“As you wish, Miss Primrose,” he said, his voice turning to ice. The formal address was a slap in the face. “I will not trouble you again.”

He turned and walked out of her life. The sound of the front door closing was the sound of a guillotine blade falling.

She had done it. She had saved her secret at the cost of her heart. The fortune, which had once seemed like the grand prize, now felt like a consolation trophy.

That evening, as planned, she made the transaction, leaving the jeweller’s back room with a heavy purse and a heavier soul. The five hundred pounds felt like thirty pieces of silver.

But as she was leaving, a shadow detached itself from a nearby doorway. It was not Jack. It was a thin, weaselly man in a cheap suit, the kind of man who made a living by watching others. He tipped his hat to her as she passed, a greasy smile on his face.

A private investigator.

A cold, sickening realization dawned on Penelope. Jack’s timing was too perfect. His knowledge of Alistair was too specific. She had been played. This wasn't just about Jack’s gambling debts.

This was Lady Augusta’s doing.

Jack wasn’t just blackmailing her; he was a pawn in Augusta’s game, sent to draw her out, to force her back into the world she came from. And the investigator was there to witness it all. Her visit to The Fox and Fiddle. Her clandestine meeting with a known criminal. Her furtive exchange with a back-alley jeweller. Augusta didn’t just have rumours anymore. She had evidence. She had witnesses.

This was the second great reversal, the one from which there was no recovery. She hadn’t contained the threat; she had walked right into a bigger, more elaborate trap. Lady Augusta now had everything she needed to utterly destroy Penelope Primrose. And Penelope knew, with absolute certainty, that she would choose the most public, most humiliating venue possible for her final, devastating revelation. The upcoming Blackwood Masquerade Ball.

**Chapter 9**

The night of the Blackwood Masquerade Ball arrived on a wave of cold dread. All of London was abuzz. It was the crowning event of the season, a night of fantasy and intrigue hosted at the Blackwoods’ magnificent London residence. For Penelope, it was the gallows.

She knew Lady Augusta would strike tonight. The masquerade theme was too perfect, a stage set for the unmasking of a fraud. Penelope had two choices: she could flee London, abandoning the fortune and the life she had tasted, or she could walk into the lion’s den and face her own immolation.

For a day, she packed. She folded her gowns, wrapped her trinkets, and stared at the piles of money she had left from her transaction. It was enough to live on for years, to disappear and start again somewhere new.

But as she looked at her reflection, she didn’t see Penelope Primrose, the aspiring lady, or even Polly Perkins, the frightened survivor. She saw a woman who was tired of running. A woman who had been given a glimpse of a life where she was admired not for a lie, but for her wit and her spirit. A life with Alistair. To run now would be to admit that she was nothing more than the fraud they believed her to be.

Polly Perkins was a survivor. But Penelope Primrose had learned courage.

She unpacked. And she began to plan her final performance.

She chose her costume with meticulous care. Not a princess or a shepherdess, but Artemis, the goddess of the hunt. Her gown was a simple, elegant column of silver silk. Her mask was a delicate filigree of silver leaves that covered only her eyes. And in her hand, she carried not a bow and arrow, but a single, perfect, white rose.

When she entered the ballroom, the crowd parted before her. The space was a breathtaking kaleidoscope of colour and light. An orchestra played from a minstrels' gallery, and hundreds of masked guests in costumes ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous laughed and danced under the glittering chandeliers.

She saw Beatrice, dressed as a woodland sprite, who rushed to her side. “Penelope! You came! I was so worried. Alistair has been acting like a bear with a sore head for days.”

“I had to come,” Penelope said, her voice calmer than she felt.

Her eyes scanned the room, searching. She found him standing alone on a balcony, staring out into the night. He was not in costume, but wore a simple black domino mask that did little to conceal his thunderous expression. He looked like a figure of judgment, a dark specter at his own family’s feast. He saw her, and for a moment, their eyes locked across the crowded room. He gave no sign of recognition, turning his back to her and looking out at the garden again. The rejection was a fresh, sharp pain.

Then, she saw her. Lady Augusta, dressed as Queen Elizabeth I, complete with a starched ruff that seemed to serve as a platform for her self-satisfaction. She was holding court near the grand staircase, and her eyes, glittering with malice, found Penelope’s. Augusta gave a slow, deliberate smile. The huntress had found her prey.

The night wore on. Penelope danced, she smiled, she made polite conversation, all the while feeling the invisible threads of Augusta’s net tightening around her. The air grew thick with a sense of impending climax.

It happened, as she knew it would, at the stroke of midnight, when the host was traditionally meant to propose a toast. Lord Blackwood senior, a florid man with a booming voice, was nowhere to be seen. Instead, it was Lady Augusta who ascended the first few steps of the grand staircase, tapping a glass for attention.

“My dear friends,” she began, her voice carrying across the suddenly silent room. “We gather tonight for fantasy and illusion. But I believe it is also a time for truth.”

This was it. Alistair had moved from the balcony to the edge of the room, his arms crossed, his face a grim mask behind the mask. He was watching, waiting for the axe to fall.

“We have amongst us a guest who is the very embodiment of illusion,” Augusta continued, her gaze pinning Penelope to the spot. “A woman who has charmed us all with her mystique. But I have recently come into possession of something that will shed a rather different light on our mysterious Miss Primrose.”

From the folds of her voluminous gown, she produced a grubby
, folded piece of paper. Penelope’s blood ran cold. It wasn’t the evidence from the investigator. It was something far worse. An old playbill.

“I give you,” Augusta announced, her voice ringing with triumph as she unfolded it, “‘Mystica Polly and her Marvelous Phantasms’! An entertainment for the masses, featuring feats of sleight of hand, cheap trickery, and fraudulent spiritualism!”

A collective gasp swept through the ballroom. All eyes turned to Penelope. She was exposed. Ruined. The silence was absolute, a crushing weight of scandal and judgment.

But in that silence, Penelope found an unexpected strength. She had known this was coming. She had prepared for it. She would not be humiliated. She would take control of her own narrative.

Before Augusta could say another word, Penelope moved. With a grace and confidence she did not feel, she walked to the base of the staircase, standing just below her accuser. She met the hundreds of staring eyes, not with shame, but with a performer’s command.

“Lady Augusta is correct,” Penelope said, her voice clear and steady. The room held its breath. “My name is not Penelope Primrose. It is Polly Perkins.”

She reached up and slowly, deliberately, removed her silver mask.

“I was not born to this life. I was born backstage. I spent my life not in drawing rooms, but in music halls. I was not taught by governesses, but by magicians, actors, and yes, fraudulent spiritualists.”

She took the white rose from her belt. Holding it between her fingers, she gave her wrist a flick—a move she had practiced a thousand times. The rose vanished. A murmur of shock ran through the crowd.

“I learned to see what others miss,” she continued, her voice gaining power. “To hear the unspoken words. To create illusions.” She opened her empty hand, and there, resting on her palm, was the white rose again. This time, the crowd gasped audibly.

“Everything Lady Augusta says is true. I am a performer. A trickster. I came here on a false premise, to win a fortune by pretending to be someone I am not.” She looked directly at Alistair, her heart in her eyes. “That was my greatest, and most regrettable, deception.”

She turned back to the stunned audience. “But I will not be defined by a playbill in the hands of a woman who delights in cruelty. I am Polly Perkins. And I am not ashamed.”

She stood there, exposed and vulnerable, her final performance complete. The silence that followed was profound. It was the silence of a world holding its judgment.

Then, a single figure detached himself from the wall. Alistair. He walked through the stunned crowd, his own mask now discarded, his eyes fixed only on her. He didn’t stop at a respectable distance. He walked right up to the staircase, to her, and took her hand—the one holding the rose.

He brought her hand to his lips, his gaze never leaving hers.

Then he turned to face his aunt, and the entire shocked assembly. His voice was quiet, but it cut through the silence like a blade.

“I have spent my entire life in the company of so-called ‘ladies of quality’,” he said, his eyes scanning the crowd with cold disdain. “I have seen their petty jealousies, their vicious gossip, their carefully veiled greed. I have never, in all that time, witnessed a display of courage, honesty, and grace to equal what I have just seen.”

He looked back at Penelope, his storm-grey eyes softening with a look of such profound admiration and love it took her breath away.

“I don’t care what your name is. I don’t care where you came from. I care about the woman who stood here tonight and chose truth over deception, courage over fear.” He raised her hand higher. “And there is no one in this room I would be more proud to have by my side.”

He had not condemned her. He had championed her. He had seen past the lies to the woman he had come to love, and he had chosen her, Polly Perkins and all, in front of the entire world. It was a reversal more stunning, more impossible, than any trick she had ever performed.

**Chapter 10**

The Blackwood Masquerade Ball ended not with a bang, but with a thousand frantic whispers. The scandal of the season had been born and then, shockingly, transformed. Lady Augusta’s moment of triumph had curdled into a public relations disaster. By defending Penelope so staunchly, Alistair, a man of unimpeachable reputation and formidable social standing, had completely reframed the narrative. Penelope was not a common fraud; she was a romantic, bohemian figure, a brave woman who had won the heart of a cynical viscount.

In the quiet aftermath, Alistair led Penelope away from the gawking crowds into the deserted library. The air was cool and smelled of leather and lemon polish. He closed the heavy oak doors, shutting out the world.

They stood in silence for a moment, the adrenaline of the confrontation slowly draining away, leaving a fragile, uncertain space between them.

“Polly,” he said, testing the name on his tongue. It sounded right. Natural.

“Alistair,” she replied, her voice trembling slightly. “You… I don’t understand. You despise deception. Everything I am is what you hate.”

“I don’t hate you,” he said, his voice raw with emotion. He reached out, his hands framing her face, his thumbs gently stroking her cheeks. “I was falling in love with Penelope Primrose, who I suspected was a brilliant illusion. And I was terrified of what would happen when the illusion ended. But tonight… tonight I saw the woman behind the curtain. And she is more magnificent than any illusion you could ever create.”

He searched her eyes. “The only thing that hurt, Polly, was that you didn't trust me. When you pushed me away, when you chose to face Jack and Augusta alone. That was the only lie that mattered.”

Tears welled in her eyes, tears of relief and regret. “I was trying to protect you. To protect this. I thought the truth would make you hate me.”

“The only thing I could ever hate,” he murmured, leaning closer, “is a life without you in it.”

And then he kissed her. It was not the tentative, interrupted kiss of the other afternoon. It was a kiss of certainty, of acceptance, of a future seized from the jaws of social ruin. It was a kiss that tasted of truth and second chances. It was the end of Penelope Primrose and the beginning of everything else.

A week later, they sat in the dried-apple-faced solicitor’s office. The air was thick with legal documents and the scent of dust.

“Well,” the solicitor, Mr. Diggle, chirped, peering at them over his spectacles. “This is all highly irregular. Highly.”

“Is it?” Alistair asked, his arm resting protectively on the back of Polly’s chair.

“The will is quite specific,” Diggle continued, tapping a bony finger on the parchment. “‘A marriage proposal from a gentleman of impeccable reputation.’ While Lord Blackwood certainly fits that description, the… ahem… public revelation of Miss… Perkins’… former life complicates the spirit of the document.”

Polly’s heart sank. After everything, was it still going to be snatched away?

“The spirit of the document?” Alistair interjected calmly. “Madame Vaudeline was a show-woman. A lover of the dramatic. A woman who, I am told, appreciated a clever trick and a grand flourish. Are you telling me she would not have considered my public declaration at the ball and our subsequent engagement the most spectacular possible fulfilment of her terms?” He raised an eyebrow. “It seems perfectly in keeping with the ‘spirit’ of a woman who left her fortune contingent on a year-long performance.”

Mr. Diggle blinked. He looked from Alistair’s resolute face to Polly’s anxious one. He seemed to weigh the potential for a protracted legal battle against the sheer, undeniable theatricality of it all. A slow, crack-faced smile spread across his lips.

“A very compelling argument, my lord,” he conceded. “Highly irregular, but compelling. I believe Madame Vaudeline would have been… delighted.”

The fortune was hers. Theirs.

Months later, the London season was a distant memory. The townhouse on Eaton Square had been sold, its stuffy formality exchanged for a sprawling, slightly ramshackle country estate Alistair had inherited—one with excellent agricultural drainage, he was pleased to note.

The scandal had, for the most part, died down, replaced by the next salacious rumour. Lady Augusta had retreated to Bath for her ‘nerves’, her social power irrevocably damaged. Beatrice was a frequent visitor, utterly thrilled with her new, fascinating sister-in-law.

One rainy afternoon, Polly and Alistair were in the estate’s library, a fire crackling in the hearth. The room was filled with Alistair’s scientific instruments and, now, a small table covered in green baize where Polly kept her cards and props.

“Alright,” Alistair said, leaning forward with intense concentration. “This time. I’m watching your hands. No distractions.”

Polly smiled, her eyes dancing. She held up three cards. With a series of fluid, deceptively simple movements, she shuffled them on the table. “Find the lady, my lord. The Queen of Hearts.”

He pointed with confident finger. “There.”

She turned the card over. It was the two of spades.

He groaned in frustration, leaning back in his chair. “How do you do that? It defies the laws of physics. My eyes see you place it there, but it is never there.”

“It’s not about physics, my love,” she said, gathering the cards. “It’s about making you look where I want you to look.” Her smile softened. “Misdirection.”

“Well,” he said, rising from his chair and coming around the table to stand behind her. He wrapped his arms around her, pulling her back against his chest. “You have certainly done that to me from the moment we met.” He rested his chin on her shoulder, his lips close to her ear. “You made me look at a world I thought was all artifice and lies, and you showed me the magic in it.”

Polly leaned into his embrace, the deck of cards lying forgotten on the table. The lie that had been Penelope Primrose had brought her here, but it was the truth of Polly Perkins that had given her everything she had ever really wanted. A home. A partner. A love that was no illusion.

“Perhaps,” she whispered, turning her head to kiss him, “there are some kinds of magic that even a man of science can believe in.”

He smiled against her lips. “I’m beginning to think you might be right.”
