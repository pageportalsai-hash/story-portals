# You Carry the River Debt

## Chapter 1: The Ledger Key

You wake before the bell because the canal has a different sound today. The water under your floorboards sloshes once, then settles, as if it hit a wall it wasn't meant to meet. The air in your apartment is damp and cool. It smells of wet stone and the faint metallic tang of the lock gears below.

You roll out of bed and touch the ledger key hanging from your neck. The key is a flat iron disk with your name etched in a sharp hand. It is heavier than it looks, and it always feels cold. When you carry it, the locks know you.

You inherited the key from your mentor, a woman who taught you to read the river's moods the way others read weather. She said the ledger wasn't just numbers but a conversation, and the locks were a reply. You had believed her. The key had never felt like a burden until today.

You remember the first time you were trusted to carry it alone. The corridor had seemed longer then, the doors heavier. Your mentor had warned you about the temptation to fix small problems by bending the ledger. Every change leaves a ripple, she had said. You had nodded, eager to impress. Now the ripples are real, and you can feel them.



The bell rings three times, a low copper note that fills the corridor. You grab your coat and step out into the passage. The floor is slick. Light from the canal lamps throws ripples onto the ceiling. The city of Pel Aris is built in concentric tunnels around the river, and your job sits at its heart.

On your way to the office, you pass the bread ovens and the fish drying racks. The smells mix with the damp air, creating a scent that belongs only to this city. The tunnel lamps hiss, throwing reflected light on the slick walls. You nod to neighbors, accepting their tired smiles. They know your work determines whether their shops open and their children drink. That knowledge walks beside you, as real as the key at your throat.


In the assessment office, the smell of ink and damp paper hits you. Sola, the clerk, is already at her desk, rubbing her hands over a brass warming plate. She looks up. "You're early," she says. Her voice is a whisper in the tall room.

"The canal changed," you reply. You hang your coat on the hook and pull the ledger from its shelf. It is bound in dark leather, swollen from years of moisture. You run your fingers over the spine, feeling the raised letters: RIVER DEBT, DISTRICT THREE.

Sola slides a cup of bitter tea toward you. The steam smells of herbs. "The locks cycled twice last night," she says. "The upper ring complained."

You flip the ledger open and scan the latest entries. Each line is a debt: water drawn from the river, water returned, water owed. The locks open or close based on this ledger. If the numbers are wrong, the river floods or starves the ring.

"Who entered last night's cycle?" you ask.

Sola points to a signature. It is not yours. It is a name you don't recognize: Lirren.

Your fingers tighten on the page. "We don't have a Lirren," you say.

Sola chews her lip, eyes flicking to the office door. She keeps her voice low. "Maybe we do, and no one told us," she says. Her whispered doubt hangs in the air like condensation.

She reaches for a stack of older reports, the pages stiff with dried river spray. "If someone is forging entries, maybe they're using an old cycle as a template," she says. You sift the reports with her, scanning numbers and names until your eyes blur. The work doesn't produce an answer, but it gives your worry a shape.



Sola shrugs. "The stamp is valid."

You touch the stamp mark. It is still slightly warm, the ink glossy. You can feel the ridge. The ledger key at your neck feels heavier, as if it knows the stamp isn't yours.

You shut the office door and test the lock twice, even though Sola is watching. The latch clicks with a clean, familiar sound, and still the unease stays. If someone can forge a stamp, they can forge a schedule. If they can forge a schedule, they can starve a ring. The chain around your neck feels like a tether.

You open the ledger again and count the last week's cycles, marking them with a pencil line in the margin. The pencil marks are a private reassurance, a way to track the rhythm by hand. Each mark is a small reminder that the river doesn't lie, even if people do.

You tuck the pencil behind your ear and close the ledger. The motion feels deliberate, a way to reset your own mind. Outside, the canal lamps flicker, and you can hear someone sweeping their stoop. The city is awake, unaware of the ledger's danger, and that ignorance feels like another weight you carry.




"I'll check the locks," you say.

You take your key and head down the spiral stairs, past the smell of bread from the lower ring, past the whisper of neighbors behind doors. The lock chamber hums ahead, a steady mechanical thrum.

As you descend, you pass a wall where someone has painted a simple wave in blue pigment. It's faded, a childlike line, but it makes you smile. The river is everywhere, even in small marks like that.

You touch the painted wave briefly, feeling the dry pigment on your fingertip. It leaves a faint blue streak on your skin, a tiny reminder of the city's dependence. You wipe it on your coat and keep going.

The paint leaves a faint mark on the fabric, a blue smear that will fade with time. You decide to leave it there as long as you can. It's a reminder that the river's story is written in more than ink.


 The river waits on the other side.

## Chapter 2: The Lock Chamber

The lock chamber is a round room lined with gears, iron teeth, and broad valves. The walls sweat in thin beads. The air is cool and metallic. The main lock wheel sits in the center, its spokes polished from years of hands.

You insert your ledger key into the wheel's hub. It clicks into place, and the wheel hums in recognition. A thin panel slides open, revealing the debt scale—a series of etched lines that rise or fall based on the ledger's values.

The scale is lower than it should be. The river is being held back.

You press your ear to the door. The sound is low and tight, like a drumskin pulled too far. When the river is free, it sounds like laughter. Today it sounds like a clenched jaw.
 You can hear it on the other side, a muffled rush like a held breath. You touch the scale's edge; it is slick with condensation.

"That's wrong," says a voice behind you. You turn and see Maris, the lock keeper. She is a broad-shouldered woman with a scar on her cheek and grease on her hands. She holds a wrench, its metal wet.

"It should be at third mark," she says, tapping the scale. "The upper ring needs its water by noon."

"The ledger says otherwise," you reply. You pull the ledger from your coat and show her the line with Lirren's signature. "This isn't my entry."

Maris squints. "But the stamp is ours."

"Which means someone used the stamp without the key," you say.

Maris wipes her hands on her pants. The cloth is damp. "We can override," she says. "But the council won't like it."

You look at the lock wheel. The metal is cold, and the wheel's spokes are damp. The river's sound on the other side is impatient, like fingers drumming.

You imagine the water pressing against the lock gates, a steady insistence. The image makes you think of the people in the upper ring, their small fountains gone dry, their kitchens waiting for a trickle. The river does not know their faces, but you do. That knowledge makes the locked gate feel like a personal choice.


You place your palm against the door and feel a faint vibration. It is steady but tense, as if the river has been told to wait too long. You picture the upper ring gardens, the lower ring workshops, the locks acting as a throat between them. The thought makes your stomach twist.
 You feel the ledger key against your chest.

"We can't override without proof," you say. "If the council audits, I'll be blamed." You hate that your voice sounds cautious, even to yourself.

Maris shifts her weight. The chamber smells of oil and wet stone. "If we don't override, the upper ring dries."

You look at the scale again. The debt line is not just low; it's descending, as if the ledger is still being adjusted. Your skin prickles.

"Someone is still in the ledger," you say.

Maris frowns. "But the office is locked. Sola is there."

You pull the ledger key off your neck. It is cold and heavy. "I'll go back. Keep the lock closed for now. If the ring complains, tell them to wait." You hear the river's murmur rise, and you feel its pressure like a weight on your back.

As you climb, the damp air feels warmer. The canal lamps flicker, sending ripple shadows across your hands. You reach the office to find Sola at her desk, the ledger open in front of her.

"Did you touch it?" you ask.

She looks up, startled. "No. I didn't even stand."

The ink on the latest line glistens as if it were just written. The name Lirren is now joined by a second line, the numbers adjusted down. The river debt is growing.

You close the ledger and lock it. The key feels heavier than ever.

You rest it on the desk for a moment and watch the chain coil like a sleeping snake. The metal catches the lamplight, dull and familiar. You have always liked the weight. It reminds you that the ledger is not an abstract thing. It is a device, a tool, and like any tool it can be misused.


Sola watches you, her hands wrapped around her tea. "If someone is inside the ledger, they'll come back," she says. Her words are quiet, but they land like a stone. You nod, because she is right. Whoever used the stamp will not stop simply because you noticed.


## Chapter 3: The Council Archive

The council archive sits in a dry room above the market tunnels, a place where the walls are lined with cracked shelves and the air smells of old paper instead of river. You climb there with the ledger key under your shirt and a folded request form in your pocket.

Archivist Rell is bent over a table, his thin fingers sorting through tags. He looks up as you enter. "You're early," he says, echoing Sola, as if the whole city knows your schedule.

"I need access to stamp logs," you say. "Specifically the ledger stamp for District Three."

Rell clicks his tongue. "That's a council privilege."

You set your request form on the table. Your signature sits at the bottom, official and stiff. "I have suspicion of unauthorized entry."

Rell runs a finger down the form. The tip of his nail is stained black. "Suspicion is not evidence."

"Then help me find evidence," you say.

He sighs and pulls a drawer. Inside are small copper plates, each etched with a stamp design. He takes the ledger stamp plate and sets it on the table. It is the same shape as the stamp in your ledger. Its edges are worn.

"The stamp was requested last night," he says, consulting a logbook. "Signed by Deputy Alder." He slides the logbook toward you. The ink smells faintly of vinegar.

You study Rell's face for any sign of concealment. He is an archivist, a person who believes the past can be tamed by shelves. If he's nervous, he hides it well. The silence between you stretches, filled only by the soft rasp of paper.


You read the signature. It is not Alder's usual hand. The letters tilt too sharply. "Alder didn't sign this," you say.

Rell shrugs. "Then someone forged it."

"Who has access to the stamp?" you ask.

"Anyone with a council request," he says. "And any archivist with keys."

"Which is how many?"

"Four."

You feel your jaw tighten. Four people could have enabled a forged stamp. Four people and a council that doesn't want to admit their ledger is compromised.

You flip through the logbook. Another entry catches your eye. Two weeks ago, a request for river debt records in District Five was signed by someone named Lirren.

"Who is Lirren?" you ask.

Rell hesitates. He taps his nail on the table. "The name appears in contracts from ten years ago. A trainee assessor. They left."

"Left?"

"Disappeared," he says. "No resignation on file." His voice drops. "The river took one of our own back then. The ledger drowned with them."

You swallow. You have never heard this story. The air in the archive feels thinner, as if even the dust is listening.

You think of the training years, of the day you learned how to mark the first cycle of spring. The ink on your fingers had smelled like iron. The ledger had felt clean then, a tool. Now it feels like a test.


"Show me the old ledger," you say.

Rell looks wary, then nods. He leads you to a locked cabinet and pulls out a water-stained ledger bound in swelling leather. It is heavy, and the smell of mildew rises as he opens it. The pages stick. On a page near the back, you see a signature: Lirren.

You touch it. The ink is faded but firm.

For a moment, you imagine the hand that wrote it, the pressure of their pen, the smell of damp paper. The signature isn't just a mark; it's a person who once stood where you stand. The thought makes Lirren feel less like a myth and more like a mirror.
 The signature matches the one in your ledger.

"They weren't a ghost," you say.

"No," Rell replies. "But no one talks about them. The council blamed the river for that loss. It's easier than admitting a ledger failed." He closes the old book. "You should be careful."

You nod, but the warning doesn't slow you. The river's new rhythm is a demand, and you can't ignore it. You take a deep breath of dusty air and leave with the old name ringing in your thoughts.


You take your request form back and leave. The market tunnels below hum with life, with voices and clinking cups.

A merchant calls out for river fish and a child replies with a joke that makes the nearby stall laugh. You pause just long enough to catch your breath. The warmth of the market feels distant from the cold in the archive, and you wonder how many people in the market know their water is governed by a ledger they will never see.
 But under that sound, you hear the river's different rhythm, as if it is waiting for you to catch up.

## Chapter 4: The Overflow Niche

You go to the overflow niche beneath District Three, where the river can be vented in an emergency. The niche is a narrow alcove, its floor lined with grates. The air is colder here, and the water smells of rust.

You can hear drips falling in a slow rhythm, like a clock that can't be wound. Each drip marks time, and each drip reminds you how quickly a small leak can become a flood. You rub your fingers together, feeling the grit from the damp stone.


Maris meets you there. She brings a lantern, its light throwing long shadows. "The upper ring sent a complaint," she says. "They're dry."

"Tell them to wait one more cycle," you say. You kneel by the grate and feel the cold air coming up. The river's pressure is building. If the ledger stays wrong, the water will back up and overflow into the tunnels.

Maris crouches beside you. Her lantern's heat warms your cheek. "If you're wrong, the council will hang you," she says quietly.

You look at her. "If I'm right, they'll still hang me."

She snorts, a quick breath. "Then why do it?"

Because the ledger is the river, you think. Because if someone is shifting numbers, they can drown the city or drain it. You don't say that. You say, "Because no one else is listening."

A drip falls from the ceiling, cold on your hand. You check the emergency valve. The iron handle is slick. You could open it and relieve pressure, but that would dump water into the lower ring.

You picture the lower ring workshops, the floor drains already damp. A surge of river water would ruin tools, soak grain, and rot wood. It would take months to recover. You squeeze the handle but don't turn it. The cold iron bites your palm.
 You let your hand rest on the handle, feeling its chill.

"I need access to the council cycle room," you say.

Maris blinks. "The cycle room? That's where they run the big ledger?"

"Yes," you say. "The council's notary watches the main ledger, but if the numbers are being altered, it's happening there."

Maris looks toward the tunnel, where the city hums. "They won't let you in."

"Then I have to find a way." You stand. The niche smells of damp iron. The lantern's flame flickers. You can't ignore the pressure building in the pipes.

"If the upper ring doesn't get water by noon, they'll breach the locks," Maris says. "They'll pry them open."

"Then we need to give them a reason to wait," you say.

You pull the ledger from your bag and rip a sheet from the back. The paper is damp and tough. You write a warning, quick and clear, and give it to Maris. "Post this at the upper ring gate. Tell them the ledger is under audit. If they open the locks, they'll flood the lower tunnels."

Maris takes it. Her fingers are rough. "They won't listen to me."

"Tell them it's from me," you say. "And if they doubt it, give them the ledger key. Let them feel the weight."

She hesitates, then nods. The lantern's glow catches her scar. "All right."

As she goes, you hear the river shift against the locks, a deep groan in the pipes. The sound makes your teeth ache. You quicken your pace, the ledger key bouncing against your chest, and try to outrun a pressure you cannot see.


You leave the niche and head for the council chambers. The air grows warmer as you climb. The smell of bread and spices fills your nose.

You pass a wall where old flood markers are carved into the stone. Your mentor once traced those lines with you, teaching you how high the water reached in bad years. You stop for a breath and place your fingers at the highest mark. The stone is cold, and the memory steadies you.
 The city is awake now, and the river beneath it is uneasy.

You pass the upper ring gate on your way, and a line has formed. People wait with buckets and jars, their faces drawn. A woman asks if the locks will open soon. You tell her the ledger is being audited. She looks at the key around your neck as if it might answer her directly. You wish it could.


In the market tunnel, a vendor offers you a roll wrapped in paper. You decline, but the warm smell follows you. People ask about the delay at the locks. You give short answers, feeling the weight of their expectations like the key against your chest.


## Chapter 5: The Cycle Room

The cycle room is a long, narrow hall behind the council chambers. Its door is guarded by two stewards in gray. Their boots are dry, their hands on iron batons.

"No entry," one says when you approach.

You lift your ledger key. "District Three assessor. I need to audit the main ledger."

The guard's eyes slide over you. "Not without a council order."

You take a breath. The hallway smells of polished stone and ink. You can hear the muffled voices of councilors behind the next door.

Their voices rise and fall, the cadence of debate. You recognize one voice as Venn's, smooth and controlled. Another voice is higher, sharp with impatience. You wonder how many of them have ever touched the lock wheel or felt the river's pressure with their palms.


You pause and adjust your coat, smoothing the damp from your sleeves. The guards watch you with bored eyes, but you can feel their attention flicker when you touch the key. The symbol still carries weight. You hope it still carries enough.


"The upper ring is dry," you say. "The ledger is being altered. If you don't let me in, the locks will fail."

The guard's jaw tightens. "Not my problem."

You reach into your coat and pull out a small brass whistle—the emergency signal for the river guardians. It is cold against your lips. "If the locks fail, it becomes everyone's problem," you say, and you blow the whistle.

The sound is sharp and piercing, slicing through the corridor. Footsteps echo. A steward rushes from the council chamber, his robe flaring. "What is this?" he snaps.

"Emergency audit," you say. "The ledger is compromised."

He looks at the guards, then at your key. He makes a quick decision. "Five minutes," he says. "No more."

The guards open the door. You step into the cycle room, and the air changes. It is cooler, dry, and smells of fresh ink. The main ledger sits on a stone pedestal, its pages wider than your torso. A notary in white sits beside it, pen poised.

The notary looks up. "This is irregular."

You point to the ledger. "I need to check the last three cycles."

The notary hesitates, then slides the ledger toward you. The pages are heavy. The ink is still damp. You scan the entries. The numbers match your ledger until the last two cycles, where the river debt suddenly shifts. The signature is Lirren.

"Who authorized this?" you ask.

The notary frowns. "It came with a council seal."

You feel your pulse rise. You glance at the seal impression. It is slightly off-center, as if the stamp was misaligned.

"Who brought the seal?" you ask.

The notary's eyes flick to the door. "A courier. Hooded."

You close the ledger. The five minutes are almost gone. You take a page from the notary's blotter, press it over the seal, and rub with your thumb, taking an impression. The paper is smooth and warm. You pocket it.

Your fingers leave faint prints on the wax. You tell yourself those prints are a promise, a way to prove you were here if the council denies it. The thought feels paranoid, but the ledger has taught you caution.


"I need a copy of the last three cycles," you say.

The notary hesitates. "No copies without council approval."

"Then you didn't see me take it," you say, and you tear the pages free. The paper resists, then gives with a soft rip. The sound echoes in the room like a confession.

The torn pages feel wrong in your hands, but you fold them carefully, keeping the wet ink from smearing. You tell yourself that if the council used secrecy as a weapon, then transparency is your only shield. The thought doesn't make the act feel cleaner, but it steadies your hands.


The notary's eyes follow you as you leave, and you feel the edge of the law like a cold line along your spine. You tell yourself the ledger was already broken. You tell yourself the city comes first.


You leave before the guards can respond. The corridor feels warmer, the air heavier. The steward watches you go, his face tight.

In your hand, the torn pages flutter. They smell of ink and stone. You can feel the river's pressure under your feet, a pulse you cannot ignore.

## Chapter 6: The Name in the Water

You meet Maris in a small tea stall near the lower ring gate. The stall smells of steeped herbs and fried dough. The owner, a thin woman with gray hair, serves you a cup without comment. The tea is hot and bitter, grounding you.

Maris is tense. "The upper ring waited," she says. "But they won't wait forever." She looks at the torn pages. "What did you find?"

You spread the pages on the table. The ink is still damp. "The main ledger shows the same entries. The seal is off, and the signature is Lirren." You show her the seal impression you took. "This is a counterfeit."

Maris touches the seal impression. Her finger leaves a slight smudge. "Who would dare?"

You think of the old ledger in the archive, the signature of Lirren fading like a ghost. "Maybe someone who knows the river," you say.

Maris leans back. "Lirren died. The river took them."

"Or that's what the council says." You stir your tea. The spoon clinks against the cup.

Maris keeps glancing toward the upper ring gate, as if she expects the door to burst open. You can feel her impatience, the tension in her shoulders. She trusts the mechanics more than the council, and you understand why. The locks are honest. People are not always.
 "What if Lirren didn't drown? What if they stayed and learned how to use the ledger from the shadows?"

Maris shakes her head. "Why would they?"

You don't have an answer. You only have the name, the forged seal, and the growing pressure in the pipes. You look out the stall window. The upper ring gate is in view, a heavy iron door with a lock that glints in the light. You can see citizens waiting, their faces tight.

"We need to flush the ledger," you say.

"We can't reset without council approval," Maris replies.

"Then we get approval," you say. "Or we make it public." The idea feels risky, like stepping onto thin ice. But secrecy has already failed.

You stand, leaving the tea half-drunk. The heat of it lingers in your chest. "We go to the council chambers. We bring the torn pages. We demand an open audit."

Maris sighs. "They'll refuse."

"Then we tell the upper ring the truth," you say. "And the lower ring too." You pick up the ledger key. It is cold, but steady in your grip. "If the river is being manipulated, everyone should know."

Maris studies you for a long moment. She nods once. "All right."

The city feels louder as you climb, the echo of footsteps in the tunnels, the calls of vendors. The river's murmur follows you. You carry the torn pages like a fragile weapon, the seal impression like a clue.

The climb feels longer than usual. Your boots echo on the stairs. The lanterns hum. The river's pressure seems to follow, as if it knows you're the hinge between its patience and its anger.


## Chapter 7: The Open Audit

The council chambers are packed when you arrive. Word has traveled. The upper ring representatives sit with tight expressions. The lower ring guilds stand in clusters, their work clothes damp and stained. The air is warm with bodies and the scent of oil.

Councilor Venn, an older man with a polished staff, stands at the dais. "We are here to hear the assessor's concerns," he announces.

You step forward. The floor is smooth stone, cool under your boots. You hold up the torn pages. "The main ledger has been altered with a forged seal. The name Lirren appears on the last two cycles. The river debt is incorrect."

A murmur sweeps the room. Venn frowns. "Lirren is a dead name."

A low hiss comes from the lower ring section. Someone spits onto the stone. The sound is small, but you feel its sting. This isn't just about a ledger anymore. It's about trust that has been worn thin.


"Then explain the signature," you say, and you place the seal impression on the dais. "This seal is misaligned. This is not our stamp."

The council notary leans forward to examine it. His brows knit. "It is not an exact match," he admits.

"Which means someone has access to a counterfeit stamp," you say. "We need an open audit of the ledger. We need to check every cycle for the last month."

Venn looks at the other councilors. "An open audit will cause panic," he says.

"The river will cause panic if it floods the lower rings or dries the upper," you reply. Your voice carries. "We can manage truth better than disaster."

A woman in the upper ring section stands. "Our gardens are already dry," she says. "We need water now."

A dredger from the lower ring shouts back. "Open the locks and you'll flood us."

The chamber erupts in voices. Venn bangs his staff. "Order!"

The clang of his staff reverberates through the stone and into your ribs. You see the upper ring representatives clench their jaws, and the lower ring guild heads fold their arms. Everyone wants the river to obey their need, and you wonder whether the ledger can ever satisfy all of them.


A child in the gallery starts to cry, the sound thin and high. The cry cuts through the argument, and for a moment the room softens. You glance upward and see a mother rocking the child, her eyes hard. The ledger is not just numbers; it's the difference between thirst and sleep.


You raise your hand. The ledger key catches the light, a cold flash. "We can solve this by resetting the ledger to the last verified cycle and reopening the locks gradually. But we need everyone's trust."

Venn looks at you. "And if your reset is wrong?"

"Then I'll take responsibility," you say. The words land heavy. You feel the key against your palm. "But we can't keep hiding."

The council murmurs among themselves. Finally Venn nods. "We will allow a public audit, supervised by the council and the guilds. The locks will remain closed until the audit is complete."

Relief doesn't come. The upper ring representatives look angry, the lower ring guilds look scared, and you feel the blame settling on your shoulders. You tighten your grip on the ledger key, the metal digging into your palm.


A wave of discontent moves through the room, but it is held in check by the weight of the moment. You exhale slowly. The audit is a step, not a solution. If Lirren is still in the city, they won't let their work be undone easily.

As the meeting breaks, you feel eyes on you from the back of the chamber. You turn and see a hooded figure slip out a side door. The bell at your neck feels heavier. You follow.

Your boots slide once on the polished stone, and you steady yourself with a hand against the wall. The wall is cool and slightly damp. The figure moves quickly, but you hear their breathing, a steady rhythm that keeps you close.

You shorten your stride to avoid slipping again, using the damp wall for balance. The cold seeps into your palm, and you welcome it, letting it sharpen your focus. The chase isn't about speed; it's about staying with the trail long enough to face it.



## Chapter 8: The Tunnel Chase

You catch the hooded figure in the maintenance tunnels, where the air is colder and smells of metal. The figure moves quickly, boots splashing through shallow water. Your own footsteps echo. The lanterns are spaced far apart, casting islands of light and long shadows.

You pass a maintenance alcove where a toolbox sits open, its metal gleaming. The sight reminds you how much of the city is held together by small, overlooked labor. The ledger is just one tool among many, but it is the one that decides who works and who waits.


"Stop!" you call. Your voice bounces off the walls.

The figure glances back. For a heartbeat, you see a face: older than you expected, eyes sharp. Then the hood is back, and the figure turns a corner.

You catch a glimpse of a hand as it swings—burned, scarred along the knuckles. The detail sticks with you. The stamp's handle in their pouch glints once in the lantern light before it disappears, and that flash feels like a dare.


You sprint. The damp air fills your lungs. A pipe drips on your head, cold. You slip once, catch yourself on a handrail. The metal is slick.

The figure reaches a junction and pauses. You are closer now. You see a belt with a small pouch, and in the pouch, a stamp handle. Your heart jumps.

"Lirren," you say, because you need a name to stop them.

The figure freezes. When they turn, you see the face more clearly. It is lined, familiar in a way you can't place. The eyes are the same shade as the ink in your ledger, dark and steady.

"You shouldn't chase ghosts," they say. The voice is calm, tired.

"You shouldn't change the ledger," you reply. Your breath is ragged. "People are going to drown."

"People already drowned," they say. "When I was a trainee, the council hid a cycle error. The lower ring flooded. They blamed the river. They blamed me." They step closer. The lantern light shows a scar on their hand, a burn shaped like the ledger seal. "I learned how to change the ledger so they couldn't ignore it again."

"By making it worse?" you ask.

They shake their head. "By forcing a reset. If the river debt climbs high enough, the council is forced to open an audit. They don't listen to whispers. They listen to alarms." They gesture toward the council chambers above. "You proved that."

You feel a mix of anger and pity. The river mutters behind you. "You could have told me," you say.

"Would you have believed me?" they ask. "You're the ledger now. You're bound to the stamp."

"I'm bound to the city," you say. "If you keep altering cycles, you'll break the locks."

Lirren looks down the tunnel. "Then stop me," they say, and step backward. The lantern flickers. You see the stamp in their pouch, a replica of your own. They turn and disappear into a side passage.

You stand for a moment, the damp air on your face. The encounter leaves you with more questions than answers. Lirren isn't a villain in the simple sense. They are a wound that never healed. You need to find a way to mend it without letting the city bleed.

You return to the council chambers with damp sleeves and a pounding heart. The crowd is still gathered, waiting for a verdict. You wonder if any of them ever held a ledger key, felt its weight, and understood what it asks of the person who carries it.


## Chapter 9: The River's Choice

The public audit begins in the cycle room. Councilors, guild heads, and citizens crowd around the main ledger. The air is thick with sweat and ink. The notary reads out numbers, and you compare them to the torn pages in your hand. The process is slow, deliberate.

Each cycle is checked. Each signature is verified. The ledger key on your neck feels like a weight and a promise. The room smells of wax and damp stone. The lanterns flicker.

Halfway through, the river debt line is recalculated. The scale in the lock chamber will rise. The upper ring representatives nod, their shoulders loosening. The lower ring guilds watch, wary. The audit confirms the ledger had been altered, and the council's faces are tight with embarrassment.

Venn clears his throat. "We will reset to the last verified cycle," he says. "The locks will open gradually."

The room exhales. But you know Lirren won't be satisfied. You feel it in your bones, like the river's pressure.

You glance toward the side door, half expecting the hooded figure to reappear. When they don't, the absence feels like a warning.

You lean against the wall and close your eyes for a moment, letting the clamor of the council fade. The stone is cool against your back. You can still picture Lirren's scarred hand and the way their eyes held both anger and exhaustion.

You know that if you see them again, you'll have to decide whether to push them away or pull them into the open. Either choice will carry consequences. The thought settles like a stone in your chest.

You remind yourself that the ledger isn't a weapon; it's a mirror. If you keep it open, people will see themselves in it, the ways they take and return. That visibility may be enough to keep the river honest.


 You whisper a quick instruction to Maris to station someone at the overflow niche, but you know she'll already be there.


As the audit ends, a messenger rushes in, breathless. "The lower ring overflow niche is opening on its own," she says. "The valve has been turned."

You and Maris exchange a look. You both know who turned it.

If the niche opens, water will flood the lower tunnels. But if it stays closed, the pressure in the locks could rupture them. The city is balanced on a thin line.

You step forward. "I need to go to the niche," you say.

Venn nods, his face pale. "Take guards."

"No," you say. "I'll take Maris." You look at the councilors. "If you want trust, let me handle this."

Venn hesitates, then nods. The room watches as you leave.

## Chapter 10: The Overflow

The overflow niche is loud when you arrive. Water thunders behind the grate. The air is cold and wet, and the floor is slick. Maris carries a lantern, its flame trembling.

The valve is open, turning slowly, its iron handle wet. You see a figure standing by it. Lirren's hood is down. Their face is calm.

"You shouldn't be here," they say.

"Neither should you," you reply. You step closer, the water's roar filling your ears. The ledger key is cold against your chest.

"If the council resets, they bury the truth again," Lirren says. "The overflow forces them to feel the river."

"It will drown the lower ring," you say. You feel the spray on your face, cold and sharp. "You can't punish the people for the council's silence."

Lirren looks at the valve. Their hand rests on it, pale against the iron. "I don't want to punish them," they say. "I want them to know."

"They know now," you say. "The audit is public. The council admitted fault." You step closer, the lantern light cutting across the wet stone. "We can change the system without flooding it."

Lirren's eyes flicker. "Will you?"

You take a breath. The water's roar is steady, relentless.

Your breath tastes of iron. You wipe your face, the dampness mixing with sweat. The niche's walls gleam in the lantern light, slick and unforgiving. You think about the lower ring families sleeping above these pipes, unaware of how close they are to a wave.
 "Yes," you say. "I'll push for a public ledger council, with guild oversight. I'll publish the cycles. No more sealed ledgers."

Lirren hesitates. You see their hand tighten on the valve.

"And if they refuse?" they ask.

"Then I resign," you say. The words are heavy but clear. "I won't hold a ledger that isn't honest."

Lirren looks at you, searching. The lantern flame flickers, throwing light into their eyes. You feel the cold spray on your lips. The moment stretches, long but not endless.

A drop of water falls from the ceiling and lands on the valve, hissing as it hits the warm metal. The sound breaks the tension. You take that as a sign the river is still listening.


Slowly, Lirren turns the valve. The iron squeals. The water's roar eases, the pressure shifting back into the pipes.

You hear a rumble from the lower tunnels, a sound of relief rather than collapse. The metal pipes creak as they settle. Maris releases a breath you didn't notice she was holding. The air still smells of wet iron, but it no longer feels like a threat.
 The niche's air becomes less violent. You exhale, your shoulders loosening.

"You make a promise," Lirren says. "Keep it."

"I will," you say.

Lirren steps back into the shadows. "Then the river will let you."

## Chapter 11: The Ledger Council

The next day, the council chambers are filled again. The air is warm and smells of oil and damp wool. You stand at the dais with Venn, Maris, Sola, and representatives from both rings. The ledger is open on the table, its pages fanned like a map.

"We propose a ledger council," Venn says, reading from a new charter. "The cycles will be published weekly. The seal will be held by three hands: a councilor, a guild head, and the assessor." He looks at you. "The ledger key will remain with the assessor, but entries will require three approvals."

You feel the weight of the key at your neck. The metal is cool, the chain warm from your skin. You nod. "I accept the oversight," you say. "I ask for one more change."

Venn raises an eyebrow. "Speak."

"The ledger stamp should be remade," you say. "We will melt the old seal and forge a new one in public. The river debt is a public trust. The stamp should be too." You look at the crowd. "No more hidden stamps." You feel your voice steady.

A murmur of approval rises. The upper ring representatives nod. The lower ring guilds lean forward. Venn glances at the other councilors, then nods.

"So be it," he says.

After the meeting, you go to the lock chamber. The scale has risen to the correct line. Maris turns the wheel, and the locks open in a controlled sigh. Water rushes through, cool and steady. The upper ring will drink, the lower ring will not flood. The river hums, a more relaxed rhythm.

Sola arrives with a small bundle. "From the council," she says. Inside is a new stamp handle, unetched. A blank tool waiting for its imprint.

You hold it. The handle is smooth, warm from being carried. It feels heavy with the future. You look at Maris. "Ready to melt the old seal?"

She grins. "I've been waiting."

## Chapter 12: The First Shared Cycle

The new ledger council meets at dawn in the assessment office. The air is cold, and the ink freezes at the nib if you let it sit too long. Sola lights a small brazier, and the smell of charcoal fills the room. Representatives from the upper ring, lower ring, and the council sit around your table, their shoulders brushing. The ledger lies open like a river of black lines.

You read the last verified cycle aloud. A guild head from the lower ring checks the numbers against her own notes. A council notary watches your hand as you write the new entry, his eyes sharp and tired. The upper ring representative, a man with cracked knuckles, asks for a pause to send a runner to his gardens.

"This is slower than we're used to," he says. His voice is not hostile, only impatient.

"Accuracy takes time," you reply. You can feel the key against your chest, warm now from your skin.

The runner returns with a report: the upper ring gardens are holding, the soil still damp. The lower ring workshops report no seepage. You write the number carefully. The pen scratches, the sound loud in the quiet room.

The upper ring representative watches every stroke. The lower ring guild head checks the numbers twice. The notary hums under his breath, counting. You feel their eyes on your hand, on the ink, on the pen's wobble. The scrutiny is uncomfortable, but you also feel a strange relief. For once, you are not alone with the ledger.
 Three people place their hands on the ledger—councilor, guild head, assessor—and press their seals into the wax. The new mark is provisional, a temporary seal until the forging.

When you carry the ledger to the lock chamber, the air there is damp and cool. Maris waits by the wheel, her sleeves rolled up. She opens the locks in a slow, measured turn. Water rushes, but not too fast. The sound is a steady flow, not a roar. You watch the scale rise to the correct line and hold.

"That's the first shared cycle," Maris says. She sounds surprised.

You nod. The moment feels ordinary and monumental at once. You step back and let the water do its work. The river doesn't know about councils or stamps, but it knows balance. For the first time in weeks, the balance feels possible.

## Chapter 13: The Waiting Crowd

Word about the new council spreads quickly. By afternoon, a crowd gathers outside the assessment office. Some come to see the ledger. Some come to complain. Some come to watch you, to see if you'll falter. The air in the corridor smells of damp coats and river stone.

A woman from the upper ring pushes forward. "Will the locks open every morning now?" she asks. Her hands are stained with soil.

"They will open by the cycle," you say. "And the cycles will be posted on the public board."

A dredger from the lower ring steps up. "What if the council changes the numbers again?" he asks.

You hold up the provisional seal, still soft in its wax. "Then you'll see it," you say. "Every mark will be public. If it changes, you'll know who touched it."

The crowd shifts, murmuring. You can feel their heat, their doubt.

An elder from the lower ring steps forward and asks to see the torn pages. You hand them over, and he reads slowly, lips moving. When he finishes, he nods once and hands them back. The nod is small but it feels like a pillar set in place.

Others step forward with their own questions. You answer as best you can, repeating the cycle numbers, pointing to the posted list, reminding them who sits on the ledger council. The repetition is tiring, but it is also the work of trust, and you accept it.



Someone in the back begins to chant the cycle numbers, their voice low and rhythmic. Another voice picks it up. Soon the numbers ripple through the corridor, spoken aloud by many mouths. It's a small thing, but it turns the ledger from a secret list into a shared song.
 Sola hands out copies of the cycle list, the ink still damp. People take them carefully, as if paper might dissolve.

You catch a glimpse of a hooded figure at the edge of the crowd. Lirren stands in the shadow of a pillar, watching. You don't approach. You let them see the posted numbers, the signatures, the provisional seal. You let them see the river debt on the wall where anyone can read it.

Later, as the crowd thins, you step outside into the main tunnel. The air is cool and smells of baking bread.

You pause to watch a baker pull loaves from an oven. The heat from the oven hits your face, and you think of the river's heat in the pipes. The baker nods at you, a small gesture of trust. You carry it with you back toward the office.

You think about how many small trusts it takes to keep a city running—the baker trusting the river for water, the gardener trusting the locks, you trusting the ledger. The chain is long, and it only holds if each link is tended.

You think of your mentor again, of the way she used to tap the ledger with a knuckle and say, "Listen." The ledger had felt like a door then. Now it feels like a bridge.

You wonder what your mentor would say about the changes. You imagine her gruff approval, the quick nod she gave when a task was done right. The thought steadies you.



 You breathe it in, letting the normal scents of the city settle you. The ledger is inside, the crowd is leaving, and the river keeps its steady pulse. You know the true test will come when the new seal is forged.

## Chapter 14: The New Current

The stamp forging happens in the public square near the river gate. A small furnace is set up, its flame bright and hot. Citizens gather, their breath visible in the cool air. The smell of charcoal and metal fills the square.

You stand with Venn, Maris, Sola, and representatives from both rings. The old seal is placed in the furnace. It glows red, then orange, then white. The metal softens. You feel the heat on your face.

When the seal is molten, Maris pours it into a mold shaped like the river's curve. The metal hisses as it cools. The crowd murmurs. The new seal is lifted, bright and raw.

People lean in to see it, to judge whether it looks different enough to matter. You see skepticism and hope on their faces. The seal isn't magic, you know. It's just a tool. But tools shape trust. You grip the stamp handle and feel the warmth of the new metal rise into your hand.
 You press the blank stamp handle into it, and the imprint takes, a shallow curve that will become the ledger's new mark.

The moment is quiet. The river murmurs behind the gate. You hear the sound of water through stone, a steady, trusting flow.

You look around at the faces in the crowd. Some are hopeful, some still guarded. You realize that a ledger council won't erase years of suspicion. It will only give the city a way to argue in the open, a way to choose together. The idea feels both fragile and strong, like the new seal cooling in the mold.
 You look at the new stamp, still warm. It is imperfect, with a tiny bubble in the metal, a reminder that no system is flawless.

"We'll mark the first cycle with it tomorrow," Venn says.

You nod. The ledger key rests against your chest, lighter than it was.

You remember the first time you wrote a cycle entry alone. Your hand had shaken then, and the ink had smeared. Now the ink dries clean. The change isn't in your hand but in the room around you. The ledger sits in the open, the door propped wide, the corridor alive with footsteps.

A young courier pauses at the threshold and asks if she can see the ledger. You gesture her in. She leans over the page, lips moving as she traces the numbers, and then she smiles—a small, surprised smile, as if the city has just let her in on a secret. You realize that the open ledger changes more than policy; it changes who feels allowed to ask questions.

The courier asks where the numbers come from, and you walk her through the lock chamber's scale and the river's cycles. She listens with a seriousness you don't expect, then thanks you before hurrying back into the corridor. The exchange feels small, but it leaves you with a quiet satisfaction. The ledger is a story now, one you can explain instead of guard.

You glance down the corridor and see Sola nod at the courier as she passes. Sola's expression is tired but softer. The office feels different with the door open, as if the air is moving more freely. You wonder how many other closed rooms in the city could use the same treatment.

You make a note to suggest open hours in the next council meeting, times when anyone can ask about the ledger. The idea feels vulnerable, but so does every honest thing. You tuck the note into your coat pocket and feel the paper crease.

Outside, someone is playing a quiet tune on a reed pipe, the notes carrying along the tunnel. The melody is simple, but it makes the corridor feel less stark. You pause to listen, and the sound sits alongside the river's hum, two currents moving through the city at once.

The player nods as you pass, and you nod back. It's a small exchange, but it reminds you that the ledger is not the only measure of the city's health. The city is also measured in these quiet moments, in shared sounds, in people who choose to stay.

You breathe in the damp air and feel the weight of the day settle into your shoulders. Tomorrow will bring new entries, but tonight the river is calm and the ledger is open.

You walk the last stretch to your door, the corridor lamps dimming behind you. The city's breath feels steady. You set the key on the table and let your hands rest, knowing you'll pick it up again with dawn.

Before you sleep, you open the window and let a breath of river air in. The sound of water is softer now, almost like a lullaby.

You close the window and sit for a moment in the dim light. The ledger isn't in your hands, but its weight is still in your mind. You let the river's rhythm ease that weight until your thoughts slow and the night takes you.

In the dark, the city keeps its quiet watch, and you sleep knowing the ledger will open again.

The river will keep moving, and you will keep listening. That is enough for this night. The river's whisper follows you into sleep. The city keeps breathing, and you do too, steady and quiet. In the morning, the ledger will open, the river will move, and you'll answer. The rhythm will return, and you will be ready for it. The river and the ledger will keep each other honest. You sleep with the river's promise beside you, steady and unbroken tonight.




 You think of Lirren in the tunnels, the scar on their hand. You haven't seen them since the niche, but you feel their presence in the new seal, a reminder that the ledger is never just numbers.

That night, you return to the lock chamber alone. The room is cool and quiet.

You trace the edge of the lock wheel with a fingertip, feeling the grooves worn by thousands of hands. The wheel is older than you, older than the council, older even than the last flood. Its steadiness is a comfort. You remind yourself that systems can be repaired, just as metal can be re-forged.

You flex your fingers and step back from the wheel. The hum in the chamber feels less threatening now, more like a companion. You take a final look at the scale before climbing out, the numbers steady.

 You set the new seal on the pedestal beside the ledger. The water in the pipes hums, steady and low.

You lower your forehead to the cool metal of the wheel and let the vibration pass through you. It's not peace, exactly, but it's closer than you have felt in weeks. The river is doing what rivers do: moving, adjusting, pressing forward. You hope the new ledger council will learn to do the same.
 You touch the lock wheel, the metal cold and reassuring.

You also touch the scar on your knuckle, a mark from your first year when a gear slipped. You had been reckless then. Now you feel older, measured by cycles and debts. The city isn't healed, but it is moving.


You picture the city: the upper ring gardens, the lower ring workshops, the council chamber, the market tunnels. The river runs through all of it, unseen but felt. The ledger is not a weapon now, but a shared tool. The debt is carried by many hands.

You take a deep breath. The air smells of metal and damp stone. You open the ledger and write the day's cycle, your pen scratching softly. It is the first line of a new current.

You sign beneath it and then, for the first time, leave the ledger open on the pedestal instead of locking it away. The corridor outside is quiet, but you can hear the river humming.

You sit on the edge of the bench for a moment, letting the sound soak into you. The hum is not a voice, but it is a presence. It makes the new seal feel less like a symbol and more like a real change.

You stand and roll your shoulders, feeling the ache of a long day. The ledger will open again tomorrow, and someone will argue about numbers, but now you believe those arguments can happen in the open. That belief is fragile, but it is yours to protect.

 The ledger, exposed, feels less like a burden and more like a shared table.

You leave the door unlatched and step into the corridor. The air smells of wet stone, and the river's hum continues. You know tomorrow will bring arguments, perhaps even new attempts at secrecy, but you also know the city has seen the ledger open. That memory will be harder to erase.

You take one last look at the posted cycle list and touch the corner of the paper. It flutters under your finger, fragile and real. You know the river will keep moving, but now the ledger moves with it, in view of everyone.

You fold the posted list once more and tuck it into your coat. It's a small souvenir, but it reminds you how far the day has shifted. You walk back toward the office with a slower pace, letting the river's hum guide your steps.

In the distance, a bell rings the evening cycle. The sound is low and steady, and you answer it with a quiet nod.

You stand by the river gate for a moment, watching the water slide through the lock. The flow is controlled, measured, and it carries bits of light from the lamps above. The sight is ordinary, but it feels like a victory. You think of the cycles ahead, of arguments that will come, and you accept them as part of the river's rhythm.

For a moment, you imagine the city months from now, used to the posted lists, the open meetings, the shared seal. You know it won't be smooth. Someone will always want a faster flow, a tighter gate, a different number. But you also know that disagreements spoken aloud are safer than the quiet ones that flood in the dark.

You take a final breath of the cool air and head back toward the assessment office. The corridor's lanterns cast rippling shadows on the wall, and you follow them like a path. There will be new cycles, new debates, and new names in the ledger, but the river will keep moving, and you will keep listening.

You glance once more at the lock gate, its iron bars glistening with moisture. The water beyond moves in a steady line, and you let your gaze follow it until it disappears into the dark. The city may never be simple, but it can be seen.



 The night will bring its own challenges, but for now the river flows and the ledger rests in the open.






FIN.
