# Neon Requiem

## Part One: The Ghost Frequency

The rain never stopped in Neo-Kowloon. It fell in sheets of acid-tinged water, washing the sins of the upper levels down to where people like Kai Tanaka lived—Level 7, where the neon signs flickered and the memories were cheap.

Kai hadn't been a detective in three years. Not since the Minamoto case, when he'd testified against the wrong people and found himself stripped of his badge, his apartment, and most of his neural implants. Now he ran a memory parlor in a converted shipping container, helping addicts relive better days for a few credits an hour.

The woman who walked in that Tuesday was the first real client he'd had in months.

"I need you to find someone," she said, her voice modulated by a cheap voice scrambler. "Someone who doesn't exist."

Kai studied her through the haze of synthetic cigarette smoke. Expensive coat. Bootleg scrambler. Running from something bigger than her bank account could handle.

"Everyone exists somewhere."

"Not her." The woman placed a memory chip on his desk. "She's my sister. Three days ago, she came to visit me. We had dinner. We talked for hours. Then she left."

"And?"

"And when I woke up the next morning, I had no memory of her. None. I only know she exists because of this." She tapped the chip. "My personal memory backup. Cloud-synced every night."

Kai felt the familiar itch of a case taking hold. "Someone wiped her from your mind."

"Not just mine. Everyone's. Her apartment is empty—has been for months, according to the building records. Her employer has no file. Even her social feeds show only my posts, responding to nothing." The woman's voice cracked. "It's like she was erased from reality."

## Part Two: The Memory Markets

The chip contained everything: the sister's name (Yuki Ishida), her face (oval, kind eyes, a scar above her left eyebrow), and twelve years of shared memories. Birthdays. Arguments. Reconciliations.

Kai started where all ghost stories began—the Memory Markets of Level 12.

The Markets operated in the gray zone between legal and lethal. Memory traders dealt in everything from nostalgia hits to full personality backups. If someone was selling stolen memories of Yuki Ishida, they'd be here.

He found his contact in a back-alley stall hung with fiber-optic dreamcatchers.

"Mama Chen." Kai slid a credit chip across the counter. "I'm looking for a complete wipe. Professional grade. Someone who could erase a person from every connected mind in the city."

Mama Chen's augmented eyes whirred as she scanned the payment. "That's not memory work, Detective. That's assassination."

"The target is still alive. Probably. I need to find her."

"If what you're describing is real, you're talking about ghost-hackers. Black-market neural terrorists." She leaned closer, her voice dropping. "Three months ago, a man came to me. Wealthy. Corporate. He wanted to buy a memory—just one specific memory, from everyone in the city who had it."

"What memory?"

"His daughter's wedding. She married someone he disapproved of. He wanted to make it like it never happened." Her laugh was bitter. "I told him it was impossible. He said he'd find someone who could."

"Did he?"

"I don't know. But a week later, I forgot his face. I only remember the conversation because I record everything." She tapped her temple. "Analog backup. Old school."

## Part Three: The Frequency

The trail led upward—past the neon wastelands of the middle levels, through the corporate security checkpoints, into the gleaming towers where the truly powerful lived.

Kai found the ghost-hacker in an abandoned broadcast station on Level 34. His name was Echo, and he operated from a throne of salvaged servers, surrounded by enough processing power to rewrite every mind in the city.

"You found me faster than I expected." Echo didn't turn from his screens. "The Ishida woman's sister?"

"You wiped her. Yuki Ishida. You erased her from everyone's memory."

"Not everyone's. Just the connected ones." Echo finally turned, and Kai saw he was young—barely twenty, with the pale skin of someone who hadn't seen real sunlight in years. "Do you know how memory works, Detective? In the old days, it was electrochemical. Personal. Now everyone's running neural implants, cloud backups, augmented recall. Memory isn't private anymore—it's networked."

"So you hacked the network."

"I found a frequency. A specific neural wavelength that, when disrupted, causes connected memories to... degrade. Not disappear—degrade. The brain fills in the gaps, creates new explanations. Mass confabulation."

"Why Yuki Ishida?"

Echo's expression flickered. "Because she was going to expose my employer. She was a journalist, investigating a corporation called Synthesis Industries. They create the implants. They own the cloud. They own everyone's memories." He gestured at his screens. "And they're about to launch a new product. A 'memory optimization' patch. Pushed to every implant in the city."

Kai felt cold. "Let me guess. It doesn't optimize memories."

"It optimizes obedience. Subtle changes. A little more trust in authority. A little less inclination to question. A little less memory of anything that makes you uncomfortable." Echo's voice dropped. "Yuki found out. She was about to publish. So Synthesis hired me to make her disappear."

"But you didn't kill her."

"No." For the first time, Echo looked uncertain. "I couldn't. I hid her instead. In the one place no one would look."

## Part Four: The Resurrection

Yuki Ishida was alive, but she wasn't anywhere physical. Echo had uploaded her entire consciousness into a quarantined server—a digital ghost, aware but unable to interact with the outside world.

"It was the only way to save her," Echo explained. "If her body was alive, Synthesis would find her. Kill her. But as data, she's invisible."

"And trapped."

"For now."

Kai stared at the server humming quietly in the corner. Inside was a woman—thoughts, memories, personality—reduced to ones and zeros. "Can you bring her back?"

"I can download her into a new body. A clone. I've been working on it, but I need time and resources that Synthesis will notice."

"Then we don't give them time to notice." Kai made a decision. "The sister has the backup. Twelve years of shared memories. That's evidence. Proof that Yuki existed, that she was investigating Synthesis."

"They'll suppress it."

"Not if we broadcast it. You found a frequency that erases memories. Can you find one that restores them?"

Echo was silent for a long moment. Then, slowly, he smiled.

"I can do better than that."

## Part Five: The Requiem

The broadcast went out at midnight on a Tuesday—the same day Yuki had been erased. It wasn't just her memories. It was everything: her investigation, Synthesis's plans, the truth about the neural implants millions of people carried in their skulls.

The frequency Echo found didn't just restore memories. It awakened them. All across the city, people remembered. They remembered the loved ones who had been erased. The truths that had been suppressed. The thoughts that had been quietly edited away.

Synthesis's stock crashed within hours. By dawn, their executives were being arrested. By noon, Yuki Ishida—downloaded into a clone body, blinking in real sunlight for the first time in months—was giving interviews.

Kai watched it all from his shipping container on Level 7, nursing a glass of synthetic whiskey.

The woman—Yuki's sister—found him that evening.

"Thank you," she said simply. "I remember her now. Really remember."

"Everyone does."

"What will you do now? You could reopen your practice. You're a hero."

Kai thought about it. The badge they'd taken. The life he'd lost. The city that would always be drowning in rain and neon and lies.

"I think I'll stay here," he said finally. "Someone needs to help people remember. In this city, that's a full-time job."

Outside, the rain fell. The neon signs flickered.

And somewhere in the cloud, a billion memories hummed with the truth.
