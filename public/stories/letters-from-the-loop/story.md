# Letters from the Loopline

## Chapter 1: Inventory Letter

Letter to the Intake Council, Day 3 of the Loopline Assignment

The train smells like cedar and ozone. The cedar comes from the banished stacks we moved into the archive car; the ozone comes from the Loopline coils that keep time from snagging. I am writing this on a paper pad because the Loopline deletes files every seventh cycle, and my mentor told me to leave a record that doesn’t depend on their systems. I am Kestrel Aday, librarian of banned books, assigned to the Loopline Inventory Unit. My objective is to catalog the banned volumes now stored in Car 9 and track any anomalies. The obstacle is that the Loopline doesn’t stay in one year. Every third station is a year off, plus or minus two. The turn came when I found a book that wasn’t on the manifest.

The book’s cover is green cloth, soft as moss, with a silver clasp that doesn’t tarnish. It was not in the ledger, but it was in the shelf where the 2071-era folklore should be. The concrete object is the clasp itself; it warms under my thumb. I am recording it here as item L-9-041. I do not open it yet. The rule is to catalog first, read later.

The Loopline is louder than I expected. The wheels hum at a pitch that makes my teeth itch. There is a ritual at every shift change: we place a brass calibration key into the wall slot, and the car’s lights pulse three times. Without the key, the cars drift. This is the signature mechanic they taught me in training. I have performed it twice already. The rhythm is comforting, a small promise that the train will not slide into the wrong year.

On the platform at Station Ledger, a boy waved as the doors closed. He held a folded paper fan with a note tucked in the ribs. I could not take it; the doors had already sealed. But I saw the note: “Looking for M.” It is probably nothing. Still, I record it. The Loopline carries letters better than people.

—Kestrel


I should describe the moment I stepped onto the Loopline. The platform at Station Ledger was cold enough to fog my breath, and the metal steps were slick with frost. The train doors opened with a sigh that felt older than the station itself, and when I crossed the threshold, the smell of cedar hit me first. It was like stepping into a portable forest, except the forest hummed. The crew offered a short orientation, a handful of rules recited in a tone that suggested they were forgetting as fast as they were speaking. “No relic trading. No unsanctioned repairs. Report drift to the conductor,” they said. A woman in a navy vest handed me a stamped card with my assignment. The card is the concrete object I keep in my pocket now; I touch it to remind myself that this is real, that I am not in a borrowed year.

After I found my bunk, I wrote down the names of the crew: Elian the conductor; Nula, the timing tech; Oren, who runs the snack counter; and a young porter named Mina who keeps the station logs with the calm of someone older than she looks. Mina told me her sister rides the Loopline between 2079 and 2083, and that she measures time by the smell of bread. “2082 smells like cinnamon,” she said. “If you ever forget where you are, follow your nose.” I laughed, and she smiled. It was the first moment the Loopline felt like a community rather than a machine.

The green clasp book unsettles me. I placed it on my bunk that first night, and I swear I felt it warm the blanket. I could hear the train shift, a low vibration that made the bunk frame quiver. The lighting in the dorm car is a soft amber, and the air feels dry despite the frost outside. I fell asleep with my hand resting on the book, not because I trusted it, but because I wanted to know if it would slip away with the drift. It did not. When I woke, the clasp was still warm, as if it had been waiting for me.

Before I wrote this letter, I watched the Loopline pass through a corridor of rain. The drops hit the windows and slid backward, not because the train was fast but because the years were pulling. The sky was gray, and the rails glowed faintly, a pale line into a year I did not recognize. I pressed my palm to the glass and felt a gentle buzz. The Loopline is alive in a way I have never experienced in a building. I think that is why I am writing. If I do not anchor these details, they will drift too.

## Chapter 2: Car 9 Log

Maintenance log entry, Car 9

Car 9 houses the banned collection: weathered atlases, defunct manifestos, oral histories of erased towns. The air is cooler in here, and the light has a green tint from the sun panels on the roof. I logged twenty-seven volumes today. The concrete object that mattered was a tin of preservative wax, which I used to seal a flaking spine.

My objective was to finish the east shelf before the next loop. The obstacle was a misaligned shelf rail that kept the books from sliding into place. The turn came when I noticed the misalignment matched a tiny warp in the car’s wall—an echo of the Loopline’s time shift. I marked it with chalk and requested a rail repair.

After lunch, I met with Conductor Elian, who keeps the Loopline’s schedule on a clip board that looks like a relic. He asked if I had seen a “ghost rider.” I told him no. He said, “Good. If you do, offer water and step back.” That was all. The Loopline has rules I don’t yet know.

I wrote a short note to my former apprentice, Rowan, who now runs the riverside branch. I told him the train smells like lightning and old paper, and that the sky outside the Loopline windows shifts with every station. The letter will be delivered through the public post in two days, if the Loopline doesn’t tear it.

—Kestrel


After the inventory shift, I walked the length of the train to clear my head. The corridor lamps flickered between pale yellow and blue, and the windows offered slices of different skies: one side showing a late-afternoon sun, the other a dusk that felt a year behind. The Loopline’s sound is not just wheels. It is the soft creak of joints, the sigh of air seals, the faint click of timing relays. I could feel the line’s pulse in my feet, like a slow drum under the floorboards.

I stopped at the crew mess and listened to the engineers talk about drift the way gardeners talk about weeds. “The line wants to go forward,” one said, stirring a cup of broth. “It pulls toward years with less friction.” Another nodded and said the Loopline’s maintenance routine was written to keep it in the most stable span, between 2081 and 2087. I realized then that the line has a preference, a corridor, a chosen path. That preference has been enforced by people whose names I don’t know. It isn’t just physics; it’s policy.

In the observation car, a passenger sat at a table with a puzzle of wooden tiles, sliding them into patterns. I asked him what year he preferred to ride. He said, “The year my daughter was born. The air smelled of lilacs then.” The concrete object there was one of his tiles, polished smooth by use. I watched him place it and thought about the bans I catalog. Each banned book is a tile removed from someone’s puzzle. The Loopline might be a moving library, but it is also a moving memory. The missing book on my shelf felt suddenly heavier.

When the train stopped at Station Gable, I stepped onto the platform to stretch. The air was colder, and the station’s clock displayed a year two numbers lower than my assignment. A vendor sold cups of steaming barley tea, and the smell was nutty and sweet. I bought a cup and warmed my hands around it, listening to the station’s announcements in a dialect I could understand but not fully claim. The Loopline’s drift was small, but it made each stop feel like a neighbor’s house where the furniture had been rearranged.

I returned to Car 9 with the green clasp book in my satchel. I did not open it. The rule is catalog first, read later, but also I feared what would happen if I broke a rule this early. Still, I took out the book and ran my fingers along the cloth. It felt like fabric that had been touched by many hands. I smelled pine resin when I lifted it. That scent does not belong on a train.

Back at my bunk, I wrote down the day’s details on a slip of paper and pinned it to the wall. My mentor taught me to leave traces in the physical world; digital logs were too easy to erase. The concrete object of this moment is the brass pin, the smallest and most ordinary tool of a librarian, and the one that keeps a story in place when the world shifts beneath it.

## Chapter 3: Letter to Rowan

Rowan,

You would like the Loopline. The stations are bright and busy, each one a different year. On my third day we stopped at Station Orchard, which sat in 2091. The air was warm, and there were trees along the platform loaded with white blossoms. People carried woven baskets of fruit, and their clothes were cut differently than ours, longer and more airy. I felt out of place, a visitor from a slightly colder year.

The Loopline’s rule is no trading in relics across years, but they sell tea from the station’s time. I bought a cup because it smelled of mint and smoke. The taste was sharp and sweet. The concrete object of the day was the cup itself. I kept it, though I know I shouldn’t. It is small and fits in my satchel beside the green book. The green book is still unopened. The clasp warms every time I touch it.

There is a rumor of someone lost on the Loopline. The crew calls them “the missing rider.” I haven’t seen them, but I find small things: a knitted glove in Car 6, a folded note behind the snack counter. The note said, “Keep the line open.” That phrase has been used by activists, but it might just be a reminder. My objective has shifted. I need to log the missing items and see if they match any passenger reports.

The obstacle is that most passengers are transient, names changing with time. The turn came when a station guard in 2084 asked me if I was “Aday from the banned stacks.” He knew my name before I said it. He handed me a sealed envelope with my name stamped in the old library’s crest. The envelope is in my pocket. I will open it when the Loopline loops again and I can be sure of my year.

Stay well. Keep the river branch open. The Loopline is a bright labyrinth, and I am learning its turns.

—Kestrel


Rowan, I should also tell you about the orchard vendor with the scar on his chin. He sold carved wooden spoons and claimed he had carved them in 2091 and kept them dry through the drift. “Wood remembers the year you cut it,” he said, tapping a spoon against his knuckles. The spoon felt warm in my hand despite the cool air, and I nearly bought it before remembering the relic rule. He noticed my hesitation and smiled. “You’re a librarian,” he said. “You always want to keep what you’re told to let go.” I told him he was right.

After I left the platform, I found a child in the corridor of Car 5 trying to fold paper into a bird. She was frustrated, her fingers stiff from the cold. I knelt and showed her the crease. The paper was soft and smelled faintly of smoke. When the bird was finished, she held it against the window, watching it “fly” against the shifting sky. She asked me if the Loopline ever visited the year where birds could read. I told her I didn’t know, but if it did, I’d catalog that too.

The missing rider rumors are spreading. Oren at the snack counter told me that passengers have been asking for an extra cup at breakfast, leaving it by the door as an offering. “Better to feed a ghost than anger it,” he said. He had a charm tied to his apron, a small brass key with no teeth. I asked where he got it. “Found it under the till,” he said. “Things show up on this train.” I told him I would log it, and he shrugged. The concrete object of the day might be that key, but the truth is the object is a rumor, a shape that keeps changing.

I keep writing your name at the bottom of each note as a way to remember my own year. It helps. It also makes me ache for the riverside branch, for the smell of wet reeds and the way the light hits the reading tables in the late afternoon. This train has no afternoon. It has a loop.


Rowan, one more thing before I open the envelope: I met an old woman on Station Orchard who sold paper lanterns shaped like fish. She said she made them in 2091 because the fish there swim close to the surface. I asked her how she knew, and she tapped her temple. “I rode the Loopline before they tightened the drift,” she said. “Back then you could get lost for weeks. But sometimes you’d come back with the right kind of lost.” I bought a lantern, then left it on the platform as the doors closed. It swayed in the wind, a brief light in a year I was leaving behind.

In Car 6, I cataloged the missing glove I found earlier. It was knitted in a pattern I recognized from the riverside branch, the same pattern our local knitters use for winter fairs. I held it up to Mina and asked if anyone had reported a missing glove. She said no, but she stared at it for a long time. “My sister knits like that,” she said. “But she rides in 2083.” The glove felt warmer than it should have. I logged it under “anomalous clothing” and tucked it into a sealed bag. It is strange how a small object can feel like a warning.

I watched the rumor officials in the lounge that evening. They sat with clipboards and cups of black coffee, listening to passengers’ conversations. When a man mentioned a detour in 2080, they wrote it down. When a woman asked about a jump to 2094, they shook their heads. Their presence made the room colder. The Loopline has rules for relics, but the rumor officials enforce a different rule: no one gets to imagine a year the train doesn’t approve. It made me want to open the green clasp book even more, as if it held an outlawed year inside.

I keep a small notebook in my apron, and on the last page I have written the years I’ve seen: 2084, 2086, 2082, 2091. The list feels like a prayer. Each year has a smell: 2084 is damp wool, 2086 is citrus peel, 2082 is coal smoke, 2091 is mint. I wonder if the Loopline itself remembers these scents or if it only remembers numbers. If I can help it remember scent, maybe I can help it remember people.

## Chapter 4: Envelope Opened

Personal log, midnight cycle

The envelope from Station 2084 was not addressed to me. It was addressed to “the librarian who carries the green clasp.” That seems to be me now. Inside was a single sheet, printed with the Loopline’s maintenance font. It read: “Rescue request. Car 7, sleeper compartment B. Passenger M. is trapped between years. Do not alert the rumor officials. Use the calibration key.”

My objective is now clear: find Passenger M and assist. The obstacle is the Loopline’s policy: crew are not allowed to intervene in temporal displacements without a tribunal order. The turn came when I realized the calibration key—the one we use for shift change—might also open the sleeper compartment’s emergency seal.

I told Conductor Elian about the note. He tightened his jaw and said, “We don’t open sealed compartments. We wait for the oversight board.” He sounded tired. I could smell coffee on his breath. I did not mention the green clasp. I asked about Car 7. He said it has been locked since the last minor derailment.

The concrete object of the night is the calibration key, brass and heavy, with a loop for a chain. I borrowed it for my shift. I told Elian I needed to check the light pulse. That was true and not true. I will go to Car 7 after the crew changes.

—Kestrel


After reading the envelope, I sat in the dim lounge and listened to the Loopline breathe. The hum of the coils made the cups on the shelf tremble. A young porter swept the aisle, her broom bristles whispering against the floor. She asked why my hands were shaking, and I told her the air was cold. She gave me a small packet of dried ginger for my tea and said it helped with drift sickness. The concrete object was the ginger packet, rough paper that smelled sharp and sweet. I slipped it into my pocket and felt steadier.

I watched Conductor Elian walk the corridor, his steps measured, his eyes on the pulse lights. He paused at each calibration slot and rested his fingers on the panel as if listening. When he passed me, I asked what the oversight board would do if the rumors about the missing rider were true. He said, “They would order a tribunal, and we would seal the car until they arrived.” He said it like a weather forecast, without anger. “And if the person inside needed air?” I asked. He looked away. “Then we would hope the air lasted.”

In the crew mess, Nula showed me the maintenance chart. It was a grid of years, a narrow ribbon of dates highlighted in blue. “We don’t go outside this unless we’re forced,” she said. “The Loopline can drift wider, but people get lost. We keep it narrow for their sake.” The chart felt like a fence drawn in ink. I wondered who decided the size of that fence. Nula asked me if the banned books bothered me. I told her the bans were older than me, older than the Loopline, and that my job was to keep them intact, not agree with them. She nodded, but her mouth was tight.

I did not sleep that night. I traced the calibration key’s grooves with my thumbnail, memorizing the way it fit in my hand. The key is heavier than it looks, a piece of brass that could open a door or lock a story. I kept it on the chain around my wrist, the cold weight a reminder that I was about to do something unapproved. The Loopline rumbled beneath me, and I could almost hear the years turning like pages.

## Chapter 5: Car 7 Door

Log entry, Car 7

Car 7 is colder than Car 9. The windows are frosted, and the light is dim, flickering with each pass through a different year. The floor vibrates with a deeper hum, as if the car is slightly off the line. My objective was to access sleeper compartment B. The obstacle was the emergency seal, a steel plate with a slot for the calibration key. The turn came when the key fit and the plate slid open with a hiss.

Inside, the air smelled of dust and old wool. A person sat on the floor, knees drawn to their chest. Their name is Maris. They are older than me by maybe ten years, their hair threaded with gray. They wore a conductor’s jacket, but without insignia. When they looked up, their eyes were clear, not glazed. “You’re late,” they said.

“I’m a librarian,” I said. “I’m not sure I was supposed to come.”

“You were the only one who could,” Maris replied. “The note was for you.”

The concrete object in the compartment was a paper ticket, frayed at the edges, marked with an old year stamp: 2078. Maris held it like a talisman. They explained, in quick whispers, that they had been on a repair shift when the Loopline’s maintenance routine misfired. The car shifted in time while they were inside, locking them between years. They could feel the years slide past like cold air.

I offered water and a blanket. I did not know what else to offer. My objective now is to get Maris out before the Loopline’s next major jump. The obstacle is the company’s rule. The turn is that Maris knows the repair routine that caused this and says it was not an accident.

—Kestrel


When I opened the seal, the hiss sounded like a long exhale. The corridor lights flickered, and a chill slid along my arms. Maris’s compartment had a single vent, clogged with dust. I scraped it clear with the tip of my pen, and the air shifted, warmer. Maris watched me with a steadiness that made me think of people who have spent years inside their own heads. “You shouldn’t be here,” they said. “But you are, and that changes the shape of the line.”

I asked Maris how long they’d been trapped. They pressed the frayed ticket to their forehead and said, “Long enough to memorize the hum.” They pointed to the panel above the bunk where a tiny coil glowed. “Every third pulse is off,” they whispered. “That’s the misfire. It stutters when it hits 2085.” I held my ear to the panel and listened. The coil’s buzz was irregular, like a heartbeat catching. The concrete object was the ticket in Maris’s hand, a fragile rectangle that kept their identity from sliding away.

Maris told me they had been part of a maintenance crew called the Meridian team, and that they were sent to adjust a secondary coil after a minor derailment. “We were told it was routine,” they said. “But the schematic we got was incomplete. The coil wasn’t on any public map.” When I asked who ordered the adjustment, they shrugged. “Orders come through the rumor officials,” they said. “They call it stabilization, but it feels like control.”

I offered the water bottle I keep in my satchel. Maris drank slowly, as if savoring the taste of a year that wasn’t theirs. “You smell like paper,” they said, and I laughed despite myself. I told them I had a green clasp book in my bag and watched their eyes flicker. “Don’t open it without a reason,” they warned. “Books on the Loopline are not always for reading.” That line stuck in me, a stone I kept turning over.

When I left the compartment, I wiped my hands on my sleeves and tried to look calm. The corridor seemed narrower. The hum of the train felt louder. I tucked the calibration key back into my pocket, its weight now a promise. I knew I was about to break a rule, but if the line was built to protect people, then the rule should bend to the person inside the sealed door.

## Chapter 6: Letter to Intake Council (Draft)

To the Intake Council,

I am drafting this letter on the train. If you receive it, it means I sent it despite the Loopline’s rules. There is a trapped passenger in Car 7. Their name is Maris. They are not a ghost. They are alive and lucid. The Loopline’s repair routine misfired and sealed them. We can free them using the calibration key during a shift change, but doing so will interrupt the Loopline’s timing for one full cycle.

My objective is to rescue Maris without causing a line failure. The obstacle is the rule against intervention. The turn came when Maris handed me a repair diagram drawn on a scrap of cloth. The diagram shows a secondary timing coil hidden behind the seat frames. This coil is not on any of the public schematics. It is part of the “year stabilization” system, and it has been quietly adjusted. Someone has been rewriting time to keep the Loopline in a narrow band.

The concrete object of this chapter is the cloth diagram. The ink is smudged, but the lines are clear. It suggests the Loopline is being tuned, not just maintained. If this is true, the missing rider might be a casualty of deliberate tuning.

I haven’t sent this letter yet. The Loopline’s internal mail is screened by rumor officials. I will send it from Station Moss in 2082 when the guards rotate. If the letter doesn’t reach you, know that I am acting anyway.

—Kestrel


I kept the draft letter folded in my pocket for two cycles, waiting for Station Moss. The Loopline’s internal mail slot is painted blue, and rumor officials stand nearby pretending not to watch. I rehearsed what I would say if they asked why a librarian was writing to the Intake Council. “Inventory discrepancies,” I would say. “Catalog errors.” The truth was heavier than those words.

In the meantime, Maris drew the repair diagram for me on a scrap of cloth torn from their jacket lining. The cloth smelled faintly of engine oil and something floral, perhaps a soap from another year. The diagram showed a coil behind the seat frames, a thin loop that intersected with the primary timing ring. “This coil shifts the line’s preference,” Maris said. “It tells the Loopline where to linger.” That meant the line’s narrow band was not just an accident; it was chosen. The thought made my throat go dry.

I tested the calibration key in the maintenance slot outside my quarters, timing the light pulses. The lights flickered three times, as expected, but on the fourth cycle there was a slight delay. I counted the seconds with my heartbeat. The delay matched Maris’s description. The concrete object here was the key itself, the way it clicked into place, the small spark that leapt when I turned it. It was a reminder that machines obeyed even when people did not.

Elian found me in the corridor with the cloth diagram spread on the floor. He crouched, his coat creaking, and studied the lines. “You didn’t get this from the public schematics,” he said.

“No,” I said.

He rubbed his jaw. “We’re not supposed to touch the secondary coil,” he said. “It’s not on the crew’s authority. If we do, the oversight board will strip our licenses.”

“Then what do we do about the person trapped?” I asked.

He didn’t answer right away. The train shuddered, a shift to a colder year. The air smelled like snow even though we were underground. Finally, he said, “If you do it, I’ll watch the door.” It was not permission, but it was support. It was enough.


I spent the afternoon in Car 9 reorganizing the banned atlases, partly to calm myself. The atlases are heavy, bound in cracked leather, their pages sewn with red thread. One atlas listed towns that no longer exist, swallowed by flood or erased by law. I laid the atlas flat and traced a route along the river where the old branch sits. It was a route I used to teach children, pointing out bends and sandbars. The concrete object here was the atlas itself, its spine stiff, its pages smelling of dust and salt.

A passenger wandered in—a teacher, judging by the chalk on her sleeves. She asked why some books were banned. I told her the official reasons: incitement, falsehood, temporal contamination. She asked the unofficial reasons. I told her truthfully that it depended on the year. “In 2093, this book is history,” I said, holding up a slim volume of workers’ songs. “In 2077, it’s a threat.” She ran her fingers over the cover and said, “Then the Loopline decides which year gets the truth.” Her words hit me like a slap. I realized that if the Loopline drifts wider, the truth might become portable again.

Later, I sat with Maris in the quiet corner of Car 9. They asked me why I became a librarian. I told them about the riverside branch, about children learning how to pronounce words that had been kept from them. “Books are a way to return what was taken,” I said. Maris nodded. “Then you understand,” they said. “They took years from us. That’s why I’m here.” I could hear the train shifting in the distance, the small clicks of time adjusting. It felt like a door about to open.

When I returned to my bunk, I found a folded note under my pillow. It read, “If you open the sealed door, the line will remember.” There was no signature. I stared at it for a long time, then tucked it into the green clasp book. The rumor officials had found a way to speak without speaking, and so had I.

## Chapter 7: Rescue Attempt

Log entry, nighttime cycle

We chose the moment between Station Moss and Station Ledger, when the Loopline passes through the longest dark span. Conductor Elian agreed to stand watch. He did not agree to the rescue, but he did not stop me. The concrete object was the calibration key, now warm from my palm.

My objective was to synchronize the key insertion with the light pulse. The obstacle was the Loopline’s timing drift, which made the lights flicker irregularly. The turn came when Maris began to hum. They said the hum was the repair song the early engineers used to keep the coils aligned. The humming steadied the lights just long enough for me to slide the key and open the seal.

Maris stepped out, blinking. The air outside the compartment smelled of metal and warm oil. We moved quickly, down the corridor to Car 9, the banned stacks, because it is the only car without active time signage. We hid them behind a shelf of censored atlases.

Then the Loopline lurched. A sudden jolt threw me against the shelf. The green clasp book fell, clattering on the floor. The clasp sprang open. Inside was not a text but a folded map with ink so fresh it smelled of pine. The map showed the Loopline with an extra station marked in red: Station Meridian. The turn hit me like the jolt: the rescue was not a detour. It was part of a route I hadn’t known existed.

—Kestrel


The rescue attempt felt like holding my breath for an entire car length. The lights pulsed, irregular, and I counted each flicker with my finger on the brass key. Maris’s humming steadied the rhythm, a low note that made the air vibrate. I watched Elian at the far end of the corridor, his back to us, pretending to check a panel while the rumor officials passed by. One official nodded to him and kept walking. I kept my eyes on the light.

When the seal slid open, the smell of cold air rushed out, and Maris stepped into the corridor like someone emerging from a frozen pond. Their shoulders were shaking, but their voice was steady. “Don’t let the door close,” they whispered. I wedged my boot in the track and pulled them free, the metal biting into my heel. The concrete object of that moment was my boot, scuffed and reliable. I never imagined a librarian’s boot would be a rescue tool.

We moved down the corridor, passing a family with blankets wrapped around their shoulders. The mother asked if everything was all right. “Just a maintenance check,” Elian said. The lie tasted like metal on my tongue. We slipped into Car 9, where the smell of old paper covered us like a blanket. Maris crouched behind a shelf of censored atlases, their breath loud in my ears. I handed them the cup I’d saved from Station Orchard, now empty but still smelling of mint. They pressed it against their lips as if it were a link to a year that was safe.

The Loopline lurched, and the green clasp book fell. The clasp opened with a click that sounded like a lock turning. When I picked up the map inside, the paper felt warm, as if it had been waiting to be seen. The red mark labeled Station Meridian pulsed under the lantern light. I thought of the boy’s note—“Looking for M”—and felt a shiver. The train was not just carrying us; it was guiding us.

I wrapped the map in my jacket and tucked it against my ribs. The smell of pine was stronger now, mingling with the paper dust and the oil from the lamps. Maris looked at the map and said, “Meridian is real.” Their voice was not relief; it was fear with a map. We were no longer just rescuers. We were participants in a route someone had hidden.

## Chapter 8: Station Meridian

Personal log, after the jolt

The Loopline stopped at a platform I have never seen. The sign read Station Meridian, and the air outside was warm, almost summer. The station was empty except for a single maintenance cart and a woman in a red coat. She raised a hand as if she expected me. The concrete object in this scene is the red coat itself, bright against the gray platform.

Maris insisted we go. “She will close the loop if we don’t,” they said. I didn’t know what that meant. My objective was to keep Maris safe and understand the map. The obstacle was the unknown station and the risk of stepping off the line. The turn came when the woman in red said my name.

“Kestrel Aday,” she said. “I’ve been waiting for the green clasp.”

I held the book in my hands. The clasp was warm. “Who are you?” I asked.

“I’m a mechanic,” she said. “A caretaker of the secondary coil. We keep the Loopline from drifting too far into future years.”

I glanced at Maris. They looked both angry and relieved. “You locked me in,” Maris said.

“I kept the line stable,” the mechanic replied. “It wasn’t personal.”

The station smelled of sun-warmed concrete and clean oil. The wind carried a faint note of oranges from somewhere beyond the platform. The woman in red showed me a panel behind the station bench. It held a second calibration slot, smaller than the one on the train. “The green clasp is the key,” she said. “We need to reset the coil.”

My objective shifted. If the green clasp is a key, then the missing rider is not just a passenger. Maris might be the key, the person who knows the song, the repair routine. The obstacle is whether we trust the mechanic. The turn is that the Loopline’s stability depends on a ritual we were never taught.

—Kestrel


Station Meridian was quiet in a way no other station had been. There were no vendors, no announcements, no drifted music from open windows. The platform’s tiles were warm under my boots, and the air smelled like orange peel and hot metal. A maintenance cart sat with its tools arranged in a precise line, wrenches and bolts laid out like instruments. The woman in the red coat—Sena—watched me as if she’d been waiting for a librarian her whole life.

Maris kept close, their hand on the green clasp book. “We shouldn’t be here,” they said, but their voice lacked conviction. Sena walked us to the platform edge and pointed at a line painted on the concrete. “That line marks where the Loopline bends,” she said. “If you step beyond it, you’ll feel the years.” I stepped close and felt a faint pressure, like the air was thicker there. The concrete object of the moment was the painted line itself, a boundary that existed only because someone had drawn it.

Sena explained that the secondary coil was installed after a major drift that stranded a crew in 2102. “We nearly lost the line,” she said. “So we made a promise: keep the Loopline in a safe band, even if it means shutting out years that are unstable.” Her tone was practical, but her eyes were tired. “Safe for whom?” Maris asked. Sena did not answer directly. “Safe for the passengers,” she said finally. “Safe for the cargo. Safe for the schedule.”

I asked why the book had the clasp, why a librarian was chosen. Sena shrugged. “The clasp is a carrier,” she said. “It is tuned to the calibration ritual. The librarians handle the banned books because you trust the rules. The Loopline needed someone who could carry a key without asking too many questions.” I felt a heat rise in my cheeks. “And Maris?” I asked. “Why trap them?”

Sena’s gaze flicked to Maris. “The misfire caught them,” she said. “I didn’t plan it. But when it happened, the oversight board told me to seal Car 7. They said a tribunal would review it. The tribunal never came.” Her voice cracked on the last word. That was the turn for me: the realization that bureaucracy could freeze a person as thoroughly as a machine could.

We stood in silence, the Loopline humming in the distance. The red coat’s fabric fluttered in a warm breeze. I could hear a faint chirp of insects, a sound I hadn’t heard inside the train. It felt like a year trying to leak in. I realized then that Station Meridian was not just a maintenance stop; it was a threshold. If we reset the coil here, we would be opening a door the Loopline had kept closed for years.


After Station Meridian appeared, the train sat in a longer silence than usual. The passengers felt it. I heard whispers in the lounge: “Are we lost?” “Is this a test?” A father pressed his palm to the window, then wiped the fog with his sleeve. The view outside was bright and steady, which felt wrong for the Loopline. It was as if we had entered a year that didn’t know how to flicker. The concrete object I noticed was a paper timetable a passenger dropped. It listed stops I had never seen. I folded it and slipped it into my pocket, a fragment of a route that might soon be real.

Maris warned me not to let the rumor officials see the map. “They will call it contraband,” they said. “And they will put it in Car 9 with the rest of the banned things.” I asked if that would be the worst outcome. Maris shook their head. “They would file it and forget it. It needs to move.” Their words made me think of the green clasp book as a courier, not a container. The Loopline itself was a courier, carrying the years like letters between strangers.

I went to the snack counter to check on Oren. He was staring at the window, his coffee untouched. “This station feels like a day I missed,” he said. “Do you ever feel that?” I told him I did. He pointed to the brass charm on his apron. “I keep this to remind me that the line keeps moving,” he said. “If the line stops, I stop.” The charm was a concrete object, a small key with no lock, but it steadied him. I told him to keep it close.

When Sena invited us to step onto the platform, I felt a twist of fear in my stomach. I wasn’t afraid of the station itself; I was afraid of what it represented. If there was a hidden station, there might be hidden years. Hidden years meant hidden stories. It felt like a library with a door I didn’t know existed. I have always wanted to open doors, but I know what happens when doors open too fast. The Loopline needed a careful hand. I didn’t know if I was that hand, but I knew I couldn’t look away.

## Chapter 9: Letter to Rowan (Unsent)

Rowan,

If you receive this, I’ve done something reckless. I stepped off the Loopline at a station that isn’t on the public maps. Station Meridian is a maintenance waypoint for a secondary coil. It’s warm and smells like oranges, which feels impossible on a train that usually smells like cold metal.

The mechanic here says the Loopline needs to be reset. She says the green clasp book is the key. I opened it, and inside was the map, not a text. That means the book was never for reading. It was for carrying. The rescue request for Maris was a collateral effect of the repair routine, not a deliberate act. The twist is that the contact with Maris was accidental, a side effect of maintenance.

My objective now is to decide whether to help reset the coil. The obstacle is the risk: if we reset, the Loopline might jump years and strand passengers. The turn came when Maris took the green clasp and began to hum the repair song. The platform lights steadied.

I can hear the Loopline’s wheels from here, a distant hum. It feels like a heartbeat. If we reset, the Loopline will open to years it has been avoiding. The banned books in Car 9 might become legal, or they might vanish. I don’t know. But I do know that the line has been narrowed by someone’s fear, and I am tired of cataloging fear.

If I don’t return, tell the river branch to keep the windows open. If I do return, I will bring a story you haven’t cataloged yet.

—Kestrel


Rowan, I keep thinking about the river branch and how we taught students that the catalog is a promise. Here, the catalog is a fence. When I told Sena that, she laughed without humor. “Then maybe you should move the fence,” she said. Maris nodded, and for the first time since I met them, I saw a spark of purpose in their eyes.

We spent an hour in the maintenance alcove, studying the secondary coil panel. Sena showed me the access slot, smaller and hidden beneath a bench. The slot had a symbol of a looped line and a dot in the center. “That dot is Meridian,” she said. “The line around it is the Loopline. It’s a reminder that the center holds the drift.” I traced the symbol with my fingertip. It was smooth, worn by many hands.

Maris took the green clasp book and opened it fully, letting the map lie across their knees. The map’s ink shimmered as if it were still wet. “This is not a book,” they said. “It’s a calibration script.” They hummed the repair song again, a tone that made the lights above us steady. I felt my teeth vibrate. The tone was not music; it was a measurement.

Sena asked if I was afraid of losing the Loopline’s stability. I told her I was afraid of losing the people on it. That was the truth. The Loopline had carried me out of the riverside branch and into this knot of years; it had also carried those banned books that had no other home. If the reset failed, those books could be lost in a year no one could reach. But if we did nothing, Maris would remain between years, and the line would stay locked to a narrow band chosen by a board that never met.

I took out the letter to you and tucked it back into my pocket. I wasn’t ready to send it. Not yet. I wanted to be able to say I chose the risk with open eyes, not under the pressure of a rumor. The Loopline’s hum kept time with my breathing as I wrote these lines, and the orange-scented air made me feel like I’d stepped into someone else’s afternoon. If I could bring that afternoon to the Loopline, perhaps it was worth the risk.

## Chapter 10: Reset

Log entry, Station Meridian

The reset required three of us: me, Maris, and the mechanic in the red coat, whose name is Sena. We placed the green clasp book into the secondary slot, and the clasp warmed until it almost burned. Maris hummed. Sena turned a wheel. I held the calibration key and counted the pulses. The concrete object that anchored me was the brass key, slick with sweat.

My objective was to keep the timing steady. The obstacle was my own fear of what a reset could do. The turn came when the platform lights went out and then came back in a different shade—brighter, almost golden. The air shifted, warmer. The Loopline’s hum changed, higher and clearer.

The train doors opened on their own. We stepped back aboard. The platform sign flickered: Station Meridian, then Station Orchard, then Station Archive. The Loopline was trying on years like coats.

Sena looked relieved and exhausted. “The line can breathe again,” she said. “It will drift, but not snap.”

Maris leaned against the wall, eyes closed. “I’m free,” they said. “But I don’t know what year we’re in.”

I laughed, a short burst, surprised by joy. The Loopline’s reset had worked, but the cost was uncertainty. My objective now is to guide the passengers through the new drift. The obstacle is the oversight board, which will not like this. The turn is that the line has opened.

—Kestrel


When we set the clasp into the slot, it clicked with a sound like a book closing. I felt a tug in my chest, not pain but a shift, as if the train’s pulse had moved closer to my own. Sena turned the wheel slowly, her knuckles pale. Maris hummed the repair song, and I counted the pulses out loud: one, two, three, four. On the fifth pulse, the platform lights flickered, and the air warmed. The smell of oranges deepened, and the metal under my hands felt less cold.

The reset took longer than I expected. There was a moment when the lights went out completely, and I stood in darkness listening to the Loopline’s wheels slow. In that silence, I heard the faint rumble of another train far below, or perhaps far ahead. It reminded me that the Loopline is not the only line, just the one we choose to ride. When the lights returned, they were brighter and had a golden tint, as if the station had caught a different sun.

Sena exhaled and leaned against the panel. “We just moved the corridor,” she said. “The line will drift wider. It’s going to be messy.” Maris laughed, a sound that startled me. “Messy is better than frozen,” they said. I nodded, feeling the truth of that in my bones.

We stepped back onto the train as the doors opened. The platform sign flickered through years, the letters rearranging themselves as if the station couldn’t decide what it wanted to be. The Loopline shuddered, then steadied. I checked the calibration key, now warm and slightly sticky in my hand. The concrete object felt altered, as if it had absorbed some of the station’s heat. I thought of the green clasp book, now empty, and felt a pang. It had served its purpose. It had been a book that did not want to be read.

As we crossed back into the train, Elian was waiting. He saw our faces and nodded once. “We’ll handle the questions,” he said. There was a resolve in his voice that hadn’t been there before. I realized the reset hadn’t just changed the Loopline’s route. It had shifted the people on it.


After the reset, the Loopline drifted through a year where the rain smelled of iron. The windows collected beads that ran backward against the glass, and the passengers murmured as if they could hear the years sliding past. We announced the drift in Car 4, and a woman asked if she should change her ticket for the year her mother was born. Elian told her to wait, to let the line settle. She nodded, but her hands kept twisting the strap of her bag.

I walked Car 7 again, now unsealed, and felt the cold air linger. The bunks were empty, the blankets folded, the small lamp in the corner still missing its shade. I picked up a cracked mug and added it to the inventory. The mug’s rim was chipped, and it smelled of stale tea. The concrete object reminded me that even empty rooms are archives. I left the door open and told Mina to bring fresh blankets when she could. “It should look lived in,” I said. She nodded, understanding that a closed door can become a rumor.

Maris asked if they could sleep in Car 9 near the atlases. I said yes and found them a cot by the map shelf. As they settled, they told me they used to read by the coil light during late shifts, memorizing the hum to keep themselves awake. “It’s a good hum,” they said. “It means the line is moving.” I told them I’d never thought of hums as promises, but now I did. The Loopline had a language beyond words, and I was learning its grammar.

Before the next station, I took the green clasp book and placed it on the shelf with the banned folklore. It felt wrong to shelve something that had been a key, but I needed it to rest. I labeled it as “artifact—do not circulate.” The label was a small strip of paper, another concrete object, and it felt like a compromise: a way to keep the book safe without pretending it was ordinary. I hoped the Loopline would forgive me for that. It had given me a door; I was giving it a shelf.

## Chapter 11: Public Log

Notice posted in Car 9, for passengers and crew

The Loopline has reset. The timing drift will be wider for the next eight cycles. Please secure your belongings. Do not trade across years. This notice is authorized by the Loopline crew under emergency maintenance.

We hung the notice in every car. The concrete object in this scene is the printed notice itself, crisp and official despite being typed on my old manual machine. Passengers reacted with fear and curiosity. Some asked if they could finally visit the years their grandparents talked about. Others clutched their bags and whispered about lost wages.

My objective is to keep the Loopline stable during the drift. The obstacle is the rumor officials who boarded at Station Ledger and demanded to know who authorized the reset. The turn came when Conductor Elian stepped forward and said, “I did.” He didn’t look at me, but he took the blame. That changed the balance between us.

Maris has been helping in Car 9, shelving books and calming passengers. They work like someone who has been waiting to be useful. Sena has disappeared back into the maintenance corridors. The green clasp book is now empty, its map burned away in the reset. I keep the clasp anyway. It is warm against my palm.

—Kestrel


We typed the notice in the small office off Car 9, the one that smells of oil and paper. I used the old manual machine because the Loopline’s terminals kept restarting with every drift. The keys were stiff, and the ribbon was faint. Elian stood over my shoulder, watching the words appear. “Emergency maintenance,” he said when I hesitated. “Make it sound official.” I did.

When we posted the notice, passengers gathered in clusters, their coats damp from the platform air. A woman with a child asked if the drift meant her appointment in 2086 would be missed. A man with a violin case said he could finally visit the year where his mentor still lived. The rumor officials arrived with clipboards and stern faces. “Who authorized this?” one of them asked. Elian lifted his chin and said, “I did.” He said it calmly, but his hand trembled. The concrete object in that moment was his clipboard, held like a shield.

Maris moved through Car 9, touching the spines of banned books as if greeting old friends. “These were illegal where I came from,” they said. “Now they’re just books.” Their eyes were bright. They told a group of passengers about the timing drift and how to read the station ledger. People listened. It felt like the Loopline was becoming a classroom, and I was back at the riverside branch, explaining how to find a book in a storm.

Sena did not appear again after the reset. I left a note for her behind the maintenance panel, a small letter that said thank you and included a copy of the new ledger. I didn’t know if she would read it, but it felt important to place it there. The Loopline is made of quiet exchanges as much as it is made of rails. If the reset taught me anything, it is that we owe each other those exchanges.

That night, Elian and I shared a pot of tea in the crew mess. He admitted he had been afraid to let the line drift. “The schedule makes people feel safe,” he said. “But the schedule is only a story we tell ourselves.” I told him the same thing I used to tell students: stories can be rewritten when they stop being true. He smiled, tired and genuine. It was the first time he looked like someone who could laugh.


The rumor officials stayed aboard for two stations, taking notes and asking questions. One of them, a thin man with a silver pin, asked me why a librarian was issuing notices. I told him the notice was a catalog entry, and that the Loopline’s drift was the largest inventory discrepancy I had ever seen. He frowned, either amused or annoyed. “You have a way with words,” he said. “Words can mislead.” I answered, “So can silence.” He wrote something down and left me alone. The exchange felt like a small victory.

At Station Ledger, a group of passengers asked for a public reading. They wanted someone to explain which years were legal for which books. I pulled a chair into Car 9 and read from the ledger, station by station. When I reached 2093, a teenager cheered because a banned science text became legal there. When I reached 2077, a man lowered his head because a workers’ history became forbidden again. The ledger was no longer just a list; it was a living schedule of what could be remembered. The concrete object was the ledger itself, open on my lap, heavy with names and dates.

That night, Elian asked if I would consider staying on the Loopline after my assignment ended. “We need librarians,” he said. “Not just for books. For people.” I told him I would think about it. The Loopline had become a kind of library, yes, but also a corridor of responsibility. I wasn’t sure I was ready to stay. Yet when I looked at the green clasp book on the shelf and the new ledger on the table, I felt the pull of the line. The work was not finished. It might never be finished. Perhaps that was the point.

## Chapter 12: Resolution Letter

To the Intake Council and the Public Archive,

I am sending this through the public post at Station Orchard. The Loopline has been reset, and the drift is wider. The banned books in Car 9 are no longer strictly banned in every year; some are legal in 2093, others forbidden in 2077. We have created a public ledger in Car 9 that lists the current legality by station. This is a systemic change. The ledger will be updated each cycle and posted in every car.

My objective was to rescue Maris and keep the Loopline from snapping. The obstacle was the secrecy of the maintenance routine. The turn is that the Loopline’s stability depended on a ritual hidden from the crew. We have made that ritual public. The calibration key will now be carried by a rotating crew member, not a single mechanic. The secondary coil access will be logged.

The concrete object I send with this letter is a copy of the new ledger, ink still drying. It smells of paper and oil, and it represents our new normal. The Loopline is no longer locked to a narrow band of years. It will drift, and we will learn to navigate that drift together.

I have established a new practice in Car 9: at the start of each cycle, a passenger signs the ledger and notes the year they are hoping to visit. It is a small ritual, but it anchors us. It also makes the drift public in a way the rumor officials cannot easily bury. The ledger now belongs to the passengers as much as to the crew. That is the change I hope to keep.

Maris has decided to stay on the Loopline for a while, helping with the calibration ritual. They stand by the slot at shift changes and hum the repair song, keeping the lights steady. Sena left a tool kit under my bunk with a note that said, “Use this if the line shakes.” I have put the kit beside the green clasp book, now an empty shell, and I think of them both as keys. The Loopline is full of keys now, not just mine.

On my last stop at Station Orchard, I sent Rowan a real letter with a pressed blossom between the pages. The blossom will wither, but I hope the scent survives the drift. I want the river branch to smell like this year, even if only for a moment. The Loopline is a train of letters and keys, a moving archive, and I am no longer only cataloging its rules. I am helping to rewrite them.

Before I sealed this letter, I asked Mina to show me the storage car where old uniforms are kept. She led me to a rack of coats tagged by year. I found a conductor’s jacket with a patch that read MERIDIAN CREW. The fabric was worn smooth at the cuffs, and a faint smell of oranges clung to it. I left it on the rack, but I logged the patch in the ledger. It felt like a small proof that the station had always been there, hidden in plain sight. That proof steadied me. It meant we weren’t inventing a new path; we were uncovering an old one.

I am leaving a copy of this letter in Car 9, tucked behind the atlas shelf, in case the public post misses it. The Loopline can be kind to paper one day and cruel the next. If the letter survives, it will be because someone chooses to keep it, not because the system permits it. That feels right. Libraries are not only shelves; they are people choosing to hold on. The Loopline taught me that holding on can look like moving forward, a slow drift guided by shared keys and shared songs.

—Kestrel Aday

The train hums outside my bunk, steady now, and I can finally sleep without counting the pulses.

FIN.
