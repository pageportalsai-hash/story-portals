# The Last Lighthouse

The letter arrived on a Tuesday, as all bad news does.

*Dear Ms. Morrison,*

*The Maritime Authority regrets to inform you that Beacon Point Lighthouse has been scheduled for full automation effective January 1st. Your services as lighthouse keeper will no longer be required...*

Eleanor folded the letter carefully and placed it in the drawer with the others. Seventeen years of letters: commendations, budget cuts, staff reductions, and now this. The final word.

She climbed the hundred and twelve steps to the lantern room, as she had every evening for forty-three years. First with her father. Then alone. The lighthouse had been built in 1887, and a Morrison had kept its light burning ever since.

Now she was the last of both.

## The Ceremony of Light

The sun was setting over the Pacific, painting the water in shades of amber and rose. Eleanor performed her ritual: checking the bulbs (three backups, always), cleaning the lens (Fresnel glass, irreplaceable), testing the rotation mechanism (newly automated, but she oiled it anyway).

The tourists who occasionally visited always asked the same question: *Why stay? Why not let the machines do it?*

They didn't understand that a lighthouse was more than equipment. It was a promise. Every night, for over a century, the light at Beacon Point had told ships: *You are not alone. Someone is watching. Someone cares if you make it home.*

A machine could project light. But could it keep vigil?

## The Ghosts

At night, Eleanor saw them sometimes—the ships that hadn't made it. Their lights on the horizon, there and then gone. Fishermen said she was imagining things, but she knew better. The sea remembered what it had taken, and sometimes it showed you.

Her father had seen them too. He'd kept a log of every ship that passed Beacon Point, every distress call answered, every rescue attempted. Eleanor had continued the tradition. Forty-three years of entries, handwritten in leather-bound journals.

The machines would not keep logs. They would not remember the Mary Ellen, which had run aground in the storm of '89. They would not know that the crew of the Persistence had named their daughter Beacon because the light had guided them through fog so thick they couldn't see their own hands.

Stories needed keepers too.

## The Storm

December brought the worst weather in two decades. The automated systems, newly installed but not yet activated, hummed their readiness. Eleanor ignored them.

She climbed her hundred and twelve steps through sheets of rain, her old knees protesting every one. The wind howled against the tower like something alive, something hungry.

And then, at midnight, the new systems failed.

A power surge. A software glitch. The kind of thing that happens to machines and never to human hands. The automated beacon went dark just as a fishing vessel—the *Esperanza*, out of San Diego—was navigating the rocks below.

Eleanor didn't hesitate. She did what Morrisons had done for five generations: she lit the emergency lanterns. Real fire. Real light. Burning oil and human will against the darkness.

The *Esperanza* saw it. Changed course. Made it to harbor with only minor damage.

In the morning, the Maritime Authority sent technicians to repair the automated system. They also sent a second letter.

*Given the events of December 15th, we are pleased to inform you that Beacon Point Lighthouse has been granted an exception to the automation schedule. Your position as lighthouse keeper is hereby extended indefinitely...*

## The Inheritance

Eleanor turned eighty on a quiet Tuesday in March. The *Esperanza*'s captain came to visit, bringing his daughter—seven years old, named Luz.

"It means 'light' in Spanish," the captain explained. "Because of you."

Eleanor showed the girl the lantern room, the Fresnel lens, the logs going back over a century. Luz listened with the kind of attention that children reserve for magic.

"Will you teach me?" she asked. "How to keep the light?"

Eleanor looked at this child named for brightness, asking to learn the old ways. She thought of all the letters in her drawer, all the storms she'd weathered, all the ships that had found their way home.

"Yes," she said. "I think I will."

That night, Eleanor climbed her hundred and twelve steps with lighter feet than she'd had in years. The sea was calm. The stars were bright. And somewhere in a little house on the mainland, a girl named Light was dreaming of lighthouses.

Some things needed to be passed on, not replaced. Some lights needed to be kept by human hands.

Eleanor Morrison was the last of her line.

But she would not be the last of her kind.
