# Shadows in the Smoke

## Chapter One: The Club

The Alabaster Room was the kind of joint where the music was hot and the clientele was cool—too cool to notice a roughed-up private eye nursing bourbon at the bar. Jack Malone had been watching the singer for three sets now, not because she was beautiful (though she was, the kind of beautiful that made men forget their own names) but because she was his client.

Vivian DuBois had walked into his office that afternoon with a problem. Someone was sending her photographs—old ones, from a past she'd thought buried. The notes that came with them were simple: *I know what you did. Pay or everyone will.*

"Find out who's sending them," she'd said, sliding five crisp hundreds across his desk. "And make them stop."

Now Jack watched her move through a torch song, her voice wrapping around the notes like smoke around a streetlamp. Whatever secrets Vivian DuBois was hiding, they hadn't dimmed her talent.

The question was whether they'd gotten someone killed.

## Chapter Two: The Photographs

The pictures were damning. Not scandalous—nothing so simple as that. They showed Vivian with a man Jack recognized from the society pages: Theodore Ashworth III, oil money and political ambitions.

The photos were dated 1942. Ashworth had been found dead in his Bel Air mansion three weeks ago.

"You knew him," Jack said when they met at a diner on Sunset.

Vivian's cigarette trembled slightly. "Everyone knew Teddy."

"Not like this. These pictures, they're... intimate."

"We were engaged." Her laugh was bitter. "Before the war, before everything. Then he went overseas and came back different. Cruel. I broke it off."

"Did he take it well?"

"Teddy never took anything well. But he moved on. Married some heiress. Made his millions. And then..." She stubbed out her cigarette. "And then someone killed him, and now someone's using our past to blackmail me. You tell me the connection, Mr. Malone."

Jack didn't have to tell her. The connection was obvious. Someone thought Vivian had killed Theodore Ashworth, and they were making her pay for it—one photograph at a time.

## Chapter Three: The Suspect

Jack's investigation took him up into the hills, where the air was cleaner and the lies were thicker. The Ashworth estate sprawled across three acres of manicured grounds, guarded by a fence and a butler who looked like he'd learned hospitality at San Quentin.

"Mrs. Ashworth will see you now."

Helena Ashworth was forty, wealthy, and unimpressed. She received Jack in a sitting room that cost more than his entire building.

"You're looking into my husband's death?"

"I'm looking into some photographs, ma'am. Your husband appears in them."

"With that singer." Helena's voice could have frozen the Pacific. "Yes, I know about her. Teddy had many... enthusiasms before our marriage. I was assured they were in the past."

"And after your marriage?"

The pause told Jack everything. "My husband was not a faithful man, Mr. Malone. But I didn't kill him for it. I had an ironclad prenuptial agreement."

"Who did kill him, then?"

"If I knew that, why would I need you?"

## Chapter Four: The Truth

The answer came at 3 AM, in a phone call from a man who wouldn't give his name.

"Stop looking into Ashworth," the voice said. "You're going to get your client killed."

"Who is this?"

"Someone who was there, the night Teddy died. Someone who knows it wasn't murder."

Jack's hand tightened on the receiver. "Explain."

"Teddy was into bad things. Things that would have ruined him if they got out. When someone started threatening him with evidence, he took the coward's way out. Staged it to look like a break-in."

"Suicide?"

"The Ashworth family doesn't do scandal. The police were paid. The death certificate was signed. And everyone moved on." A long pause. "Except someone found out about the coverup. And they're using it."

"Who?"

"Look at who benefits, Mr. Malone. Who gets everything if Helena goes down for murder?"

The phone went dead. But Jack didn't need any more hints.

## Chapter Five: The Finale

The killer—the blackmailer—was Michael Ashworth. Theodore's younger brother, cut out of the will, desperate for money. He'd found out about Teddy's suicide and spun it into a scheme: blackmail Vivian, point the police toward her, watch Helena take the fall for a murder that never happened.

Jack found him at the Alabaster Room, watching Vivian sing. His gun was in his pocket and his plan was in ruins.

"It's over, Michael."

"Nothing's over." Michael's smile was the kind that never reached the eyes. "She's still the perfect suspect. No one's going to believe—"

"The police might not. But I've got your brother's suicide note. The real one, that you hid. And I've got a recording of that phone call you made." Jack shook his head. "You wanted to be clever. You just ended up being caught."

Michael went for his gun. He was too slow.

Later, after the police had come and gone, Vivian found Jack at the bar.

"Thank you," she said. "For believing me."

"I don't believe anyone, Miss DuBois. I just follow the evidence." He raised his glass. "But for what it's worth—I'm glad it wasn't you."

She smiled, and for a moment, the shadows lifted.

"Sing me a song," Jack said. "Something hopeful."

And in the Alabaster Room, with the smoke curling toward the ceiling and the night stretching out toward dawn, Vivian DuBois sang.
