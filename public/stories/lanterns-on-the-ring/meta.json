  "synopsis": "In a class-tiered orbital habitat, archivist Ilya Nadir uncovers a reprinting map that reveals a hidden corridor used to shelter uncounted travelers. Torn between clearing her family’s century-old debt and protecting a community’s protective silence, she forges a new ledger entry and works with rival cartographer Rhea to keep the route alive. The twist: the map is lying on purpose, a deliberate pattern of mercy hidden in plain sight.",
