# Echoes of Andromeda

## Transmission 1: The Message

The *Wanderer* had been falling toward Kepler-442b for 127 years when Dr. Maya Okonkwo first heard the signal.

She was third-generation shipborn, a linguist who had never seen Earth except in archives. Her job was theoretical—maintaining the AI translation systems, preparing protocols for contact scenarios that everyone agreed would never happen. The universe, after all, was almost certainly empty.

The signal changed everything.

It came through on the deep-space array at 0342 ship time, a burst of organized radio waves that made Maya's coffee go cold in her hand. Not random noise. Not pulsar interference. Pattern.

*Hello,* it said, in a language that had never been spoken aloud. *We heard you. We have been waiting.*

## Transmission 2: The Archive

The message humanity had sent was called the Beacon Protocol—a comprehensive introduction broadcast toward promising star systems in 2089. Mathematics. Chemistry. Biology. Music and art and a hundred hours of human voices saying "hello" in every language.

The *Wanderer* had been launched twenty years later, but they'd carried the Beacon records. Maya had studied them as a graduate student: the careful optimism, the assumption that if anyone was listening, they would want to understand.

Now someone had answered.

The reply was structured like the original Beacon—mathematical primers first, then chemistry, then something new. Something that made Maya's hands shake.

*We learned your symbols. Now learn ours.*

What followed was a language. Complete. Beautiful. Alien.

## Transmission 3: The Translation

Maya worked for forty-seven days straight, sleeping only when the ship's AI forced her to. The alien language—she called it Echo, for the way it seemed to reflect humanity's message back transformed—was unlike anything in her training.

Human languages were linear. Echo was dimensional. Words existed in relationship to each other, their meaning shifting based on position, context, and something Maya could only describe as *emotional resonance*. A single phrase could mean three different things depending on whether the speaker was happy, sad, or afraid.

"It's designed for truth," she told Captain Chen during her first report. "You can't lie in Echo. The emotional markers would contradict the semantic content."

"Is that good or bad?"

Maya considered. "For diplomacy? I have no idea. For understanding each other? It might be the most important thing they could have given us."

## Transmission 4: The Question

After two months, Maya could read Echo well enough to understand the rest of the message. And it was a message—not a broadcast, but a letter. Addressed specifically to the *Wanderer*.

*We know you are traveling. We have watched your small light crossing the dark. We want to meet you, but we have a question first.*

*Why did you leave?*

Maya stared at the screen for a long time. In Echo, the question carried layers. Why did you leave your home? Why did you leave safety? Why did you reach out into the nothing?

She thought about the archives. The climate wars. The resource collapses. The desperate hope that somewhere else might be better than here.

But that wasn't the whole truth. People had left Earth because humans were explorers. Wanderers. Because the stars were there, and not looking at them was harder than the looking.

How do you say that in a language that doesn't allow lies?

## Transmission 5: The Answer

Maya composed her response over three weeks, checking every emotional marker, every semantic relationship. The message went out on the ship's anniversary—300 years since the Beacon Protocol was first transmitted.

*We left because we are restless,* she wrote. *Because we are afraid of being alone. Because we wanted to know if the universe was full of light or if we were the only spark.*

*We are still afraid. But we are glad you answered.*

The reply came faster this time—only eighteen days.

*We asked because we left too. Long ago. Our home star is dying. We have been traveling for longer than your species has existed.*

*We are glad to no longer be alone.*

## Transmission 6: The Meeting

The *Wanderer* altered course. Not much—a few degrees, a few decades added to a journey already measured in centuries. But enough to intersect with the Echo ship in 2241.

Maya wouldn't live to see it. Neither would her children, or their children. But she had given them something better than arrival: she had given them a reason.

On her last day, ninety-seven years old and surrounded by the linguists she had trained, Maya received one final transmission. It was short. Just three words in Echo.

But those three words, with all their dimensional meaning, their emotional resonance, their untranslatable depth, said everything:

*We are coming.*

And in Echo, that meant: *We are not afraid. We are not alone. We are becoming friends.*

Maya smiled, and closed her eyes, and let the universe keep speaking.
