A hand found a shoulder, steadying it without permission. She held the waiver stamp up to the light, checking for a flaw.

A low hum rang from the relay box. Keel held the flashlamp and kept the objective to get to the northern basin in view, even as night patrols tightened around them. A hand found a shoulder, steadying it without permission. They traced the edge of the flashlamp, grounding themselves in its weight.
