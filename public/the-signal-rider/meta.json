When the cargo reveals itself as a weapon designed to erase entire populations from history, Kai and his newly-voiced ship must break the contract, outrun cosmic enforcement, and choose conscience over credits—sparking a rebellion that could rewrite what it means to be human, machine, and remembered.",
